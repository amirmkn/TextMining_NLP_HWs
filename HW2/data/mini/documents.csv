In the United States, a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) is an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) who has acquired graduate-level education and board certification in anesthesia. Today, nurse anesthetists practice in all 50 United States and administer approximately 34 million anesthetics each year (AANA). CRNA practice varies from state to state, and is also dependent on the institution in which CRNAs practice."
1,"Anaesthetic Nurse. The anaesthetic nurse provides the primary support to the patient and anaesthetist throughout anaesthetic process. With the anaesthetist supervision, the anaesthetic nurse ensures the safety the patient during the course of the anaesthetic. Perioperative nurses care for patients in the period prior, during and following surgery or interventional procedures, perioperative nursing encompasses a range of specialised roles including, but not limited to:"
2,"Career Overview. A nurse anesthetist, or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), is a licensed professional nurse who provides the same anesthesia services as an anesthesiologist (MD). After completing extensive education and training, CRNAs become nationally certified and may then practice in all 50 states. A nurse anesthetist, or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), is a licensed professional nurse who provides the same anesthesia services as an anesthesiologist (MD)"
3,"Administering Anesthesiology. A nurse anesthetist is a specialty-trained registered nurse who administers anesthesia to patients who are undergoing surgeries or special procedures. Nurse anesthetists have a unique approach to patient care, grounded in a nursing perspective. CRNAs are anesthesia professionals who safely administer more than 34 million anesthetics to patients each year in the United States, according to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) 2012 Practice Profile Survey."
4,"In Kansas, CRNAs make up 70 percent of the anesthesia providers, and 83 percent of the hospitals in our state rely exclusively on CRNAs for anesthesia care. Generally, the path to becoming a CRNA begins with a 4-year undergraduate degree in nursing or another field. Although it is not required to possess a degree in nursing, a current license as a registered nurse is required to enter a nurse anesthesia program."
5,"CRNAs administer anesthesia and anesthesia-related care in four general categories: (1) pre-anesthetic preparation and evaluation; (2) anesthesia induction, maintenance and emergence; (3) post-anesthesia care; and (4) perianesthetic and clinical support functions. Generally, the path to becoming a CRNA begins with a 4-year undergraduate degree in nursing or another field. Although it is not required to possess a degree in nursing, a current license as a registered nurse is required to enter a nurse anesthesia program."

The severity of symptoms, and how often they appear, varies quite a bit from person to person. In relapsing polychondritis, cartilage becomes inflamed, causing redness, swelling, irritation, discomfort and pain in the affected areas. The inflammation of this disease may cause your windpipe, or trachea, to narrow, resulting in hoarseness, shortness of breath and wheezing."

It uses lye, 300-degree heat and 60 pounds of pressure per square inch to destroy bodies in big stainless-steel cylinders that are similar to pressure cookers. Since they first walked the planet, humans have either buried or burned their dead. Now a new option is generating interest — dissolving bodies in lye and flushing the brownish, syrupy residue down the drain."
57,"Lye is also made from wood ash, but that lye is inconsistent and makes a very soft bar. If you want to learn how to make lye this way, there are many tutorials available on the internet. I’ve wanted to try making Black Soap using banana leaves that is done much the same way. "

78,"Lipids. Lipids are important constituent of of the diet because they are a source of high energy value. Lipids are also important because of the fat-soluble vitamins, and essential fatty acids found in the fat of the natural food stuffs. Body fat serves as a very good source of energy, it is stored in adipose tissues. Characteristics of Lipids. 1  Lipids are relatively insoluble in water. 2  They are soluble in non-polar solvents, like ether, chloroform, methanol. 3  Lipids have high energy content and are metabolized to release calories. 4  Lipids also act as electrical insulators, they insulate nerve axon"
79,"A flagellum is a whip-like structure that allows a cell to move. They are found in all three domains of the living world: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota. While all three types of flagella are used for locomotion, they are structurally very different. Cilia are similar to flagella in structure and function, but a cilium is shorter and moves differently. A ciliated cell usually has hundreds or thousands of cilia, which move in unison like little oars."
80,"A flagellum (/fləˈdʒɛləm/ ; plural: flagella) is a lash-like appendage that protrudes from the cell body of certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The word flagellum in Latin means whip. An example of a eukaryotic flagellate cell is the mammalian sperm cell, which uses its flagellum to propel itself through the female reproductive tract. Eukaryotic flagella are structurally identical to eukaryotic cilia, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length."
81,"Flagella are long, thread-like appendages which provide some live single cells with the ability to move, motility. Bacteria which have flagella are either rod or spiral-shaped and are known as bacilli and spirochetes, respectively. Cocci, or round bacteria, are almost all nonmotile. Animal sperm cells also have flagella. However, prokaryotic cells (such as bacteria) have flagella made up of the protein flagellin. Whereas, eukaryotic cells (such as sperm) which have a nucleus have flagella composed of tubulin proteins."
82,"Cilia and Flagella Cilia and flagella are motile cellular appendages found in most microorganisms and animals, but not in higher plants. In multicellular organisms, cilia function to move a cell or group of cells or to help transport fluid or materials past them."
83,"A flagellum is a whip-like structure that allows a cell to move. They are found in all three domains of the living world: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota, also known as protists, plants, animals, and fungi. Cilia are similar to flagella in structure and function, but a cilium is shorter and moves differently. A ciliated cell usually has hundreds or thousands of cilia, which move in unison like little oars."
84,"The flagella of domains bacteria and archaea are different. They still move the cell, but they do so by rotating, rather than by bending from the inside like eukaryotic flagella. The flagella of archaeans are superficially similar to those of bacteria. However, there are key differences. Cilia are similar to flagella in structure and function, but a cilium is shorter and moves differently. A ciliated cell usually has hundreds or thousands of cilia, which move in unison like little oars."
85,"Cilia and flagella are cell organelles that are structurally similar but are differentiated based on their function and/or length. Cilia are short and there are usually many (hundreds) cilia per cell. On the other hand, flagella are longer and there are fewer flagella per cell (usually one to eight). Though eukaryotic flagella and motile cilia are structurally identical, the beating pattern of the two organelles can be different."
86,"Cilia, flagella, and centrioles. Cilia and flagella are projections from the cell. They are made up of microtubules, as shown in this cartoon and are covered by an extension of the plasma membrane. They are motile and designed either to move the cell itself or to move substances over or around the cell. "
87,"Yes A flagellum, also called undulipodium, is a whip-like structure used for locomotion, for feeding or other purposes. Almost all organisms have flagella to include protozo … a (at some stage in their lives). We humans have them in our bodies. Even our own spermatozoa can be regarded as flagellates. "
88,"The primary role of the flagellum is locomotion but it also often has function as a sensory organelle, being sensitive to chemicals and temperatures outside the cell. Flagella are organelles defined by function rather than structure. There are large differences between different types of flagella; the prokaryotic and eukaryotic flagella differ greatly in protein composition, structure, and mechanism of propulsion. An example of a eukaryotic flagellate cell is the mammalian sperm cell, which uses its flagellum to propel itself through the female reproductive tract. Eukaryotic flagella are structurally identical to eukaryotic cilia, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length."
89,"Dinosaurs types are many and varied, from small bird-like creatures to the largest animals ever to walk on Earth. The subject of blockbuster films, history museum exhibits and much more, dinosaurs continue to interest people today after first appearing approximately 230 million years ago. These vertebrate animals dominated the land for more than 160 million years before experiencing a catastrophic extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago. The first dinosaur was recognized in the 19th century and ever since, dinosaurs have been the source of many questions."
90,"In 1888, a man named Harry Seeley proposed a way of classifying dinosaurs into two groups by looking at their hip structure, these groups are called Saurischia (lizard hipped) and Ornithischia (bird hipped).

Gruit is a term that refers to both the mixture of herbs and spices used to flavor beer or mead as well as the alcoholic beverage flavored with such herbs and spices. There’s no one particular mixture of herbs and spices used in gruit – every brewer had their own proprietary combination.
137,The exclusive use of gruit was gradually phased out in favor of the use of hops alone in a slow sweep across Europe occurring between the 11th century (in the south and east of the Holy Roman Empire) and the late 16th century (Great Britain).

203,"In summary, skeletal muscles are attached to bones on each end by tendons. The origin is the fixed attachment, while the insertion moves with contraction. The action, or particular movement of a muscle, can be described relative to the joint or the body part moved. Groups of muscles are involved in most movements and names are used to describe the role of each muscle involved. The origin is the attachment site that doesn't move during contraction, while the insertion is the attachment site that does move when the muscle contracts. The insertion is usually distal, or further away, while the origin is proximal, or closer to the body, relative to the insertion."

221,"In contrast, fibers from natural sources are provided by nature in ready-made form. Natural fibers include the protein fibers such as wool and silk, the cellulose fibers such as cotton and linen, and the mineral fiber asbestos. Plant fibers can be further on classified as: 1  Fibre occurring on the seed (raw cotton, java cotton). 2  Phloem fiber (flax, ramie, hemp, jute). "
222,"A cellulose molecule may be from several hundred to over 10,000 glucose units long. Cellulose is similar in form to complex carbohydrates like starch and glycogen. These polysaccharides are also made from multiple subunits of glucose. The difference between cellulose and other complex carbohydrate molecules is how the glucose molecules are linked together. In addition, cellulose is a straight chain polymer, and each cellulose molecule is long and rod-like."

226,"Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic string used as a component of composite materials, or, when matted into sheets, used to make products such as paper, papyrus, or felt. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. Natural fibers include those produced by plants, animals, and geological processes and can be classified according to their origin: 1  Vegetable fibers are generally based on arrangements of cellulose, often with lignin: examples include cotton, hemp, jute, flax, ramie, sisal, bagasse, and banana."
227,"Processed grains lose much of their fiber content. Fiber can be either soluble or insoluble. The form of cellulose used in foods is soluble fiber. It is important to eat other food sources containing insoluble fiber, such as wheat bran, vegetables and whole grain, to gain the maximum contribution of fiber to health. Adult males should consume at least 38 grams of fiber daily; adult women should consume at least 25 grams. If you are over 50, you may require less fiber in your diet. Chances are, you do not consume this much fiber on a daily basis. Cellulose is added to foods, in part, to aid in increasing your fiber intake."

231,"Background. Thyroid hormone is responsible for the regulating the metabolic rate of every cell in the body Since every cell in the body depends on its metabolism to perform its function, when the thyroid system is malfunctioning it can affect every system of the body. Testing Thyroid Function Ways to test the thyroid by laboratory test and basal temperature are discussed. Iodine Uses that the body has for iodine, its importance in hormone production and metabolism and the role and safety of iodine/iodide supplementation."
232,"The Thyroid Affects So Many Parts of the Body. In today’s health care system there are many specialists. It is easy to lose track of the fact that the body is a group of ecosystems, all interconnected and interacting. The thyroid is a perfect example of all these complex interactions and connections. The pancreas and thyroid are both part of the endocrine system. The endocrine system is made of many feedback loops and their various hormones all “talk” to one another and make changes to the body to try and keep things in balance."
233,"The thyroid gland is located in the front lower part of the neck. Hormones released by the gland travel through your bloodstream and affect nearly every part of your body, from your heart and brain, to your muscles and skin. The thyroid controls how your body's cells use energy from food, a process called metabolism."

T3 and T4 Combinations. Triiodothyronine (T3), the other important thyroid hormone, is not ordinarily prescribed except under special circumstances. Most patients respond well to thyroxine (T4) alone, which is converted in the body into T3. In addition, the use of T3 may cause disturbances in heart rhythms."
235,"The Thyroid itself secretes three main hormones: 1  Thyroxine contains iodine which is essential for the body's normal growth, and metabolism. 2  Triiodothyronine has similar functions to thyroxine. 3  Calcitonin causes a decrease in the concentration of calcium in the blood. Hormones. are secreted from the glands of the endocrine system, they are specific in that each hormone causes a response in a specific target organ or group of cells, rather than on the body as a whole. Exocrine hormones are secreted via a duct into the blood and usually effect a distant organ or tissue."
236,"The function of the thyroid gland is to take iodine, found in many foods, and convert it into thyroid hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid cells are the only cells in the body which can absorb iodine. These cells combine iodine and the amino acid tyrosine to make T3 and T4. "

239,"The thyroid hormone thyroxine is also called T4 and is scientifically known as 3, 5, 3’5,’-tetraiodothyronine. It is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland and is a very important hormone in the body. The function of thyroxine involves the stimulation of oxygen consumption which leads to tissue and cellular metabolism. Along with that, it is used as a biochemical indicator of the functioning of the thyroid gland. Thyroxine is also converted by the kidney and the liver and turned to other kinds of hormones. Because it plays such an important role in numerous functions of the body, having too much or too little of the thyroid hormone can cause problems"
240,"The thyroid is part of the endocrine system and produces, stores and releases hormones that affects your metabolism. The thyroid gland uses iodine from the foods you eat to make these hormones. Additionally, the thyroid plays an important role in lipid regulation and has been shown to affect cholesterol levels. As with most all hormones, levels of one hormone can affect levels of another hormone. TRH, for example, has a key role in thyroid hormone level and has also been linked to growth hormone, adrenaline and insulin secretion. Low thyroid hormone levels have also been linked to elevated"

243,"Coccidioidomycosis, also called valley fever, is an illness caused by a fungus that is common in some parts of the United States. Valley fever is caused by Coccidioides, a fungus that lives in soil in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. Inhaling the airborne fungal spores can cause an infection called coccidioidomycosis, which is also known as “cocci” or “valley fever.” Most people who are exposed to the fungus do not get sick, but some people develop flu-like symptoms that may last for weeks to months."

245,"Definition. Valley fever is a fungal infection caused by coccidioides (kok-sid-e-OY-deze) organisms. It can cause fever, chest pain and coughing, among other signs and symptoms. Two species of coccidioides fungi cause valley fever. These fungi are commonly found in soil in specific regions. The fungi can then be breathed into the lungs and cause valley fever, also known as acute coccidioidomycosis (kok-sid-e-oy-doh-my-KOH-sis). Mild cases of valley fever usually resolve on their own. In more severe cases, doctors prescribe antifungal medications that can treat the underlying infection. 1  Symptoms."

Most people get better without treatment. But if your body's natural defense system (immune system) is weak, valley fever can be deadly."
247,"Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis, or cocci) is caused by the soil-dwelling fungus, Coccidioides immitis. The tiny seeds, or spores, become wind-borne and are inhaled into the lungs, where the infection starts. When soils containing the fungus are disturbed and dust is raised, spores may be inhaled with the dust. "

316,"1 This trait is a derived character-state (in relation to poikilothermy, the character-state inferred to have been that of the last common ancestor of both groups), which therefore is hypothesized to have evolved independently in these two groups (or at least in the larger clades to which these groups belong).

Derived traits are those that just appeared (by mutation) in the most recent ancestor -- the one that gave rise to a newly formed branch.

Functionally similar features arising through convergent evolution are termed analogous, in contrast to homologous structures or traits, which have a common origin, but not necessarily similar function."

384,"These numbers represent total sleep duration—-how much babies slept over a 24-hour period. Of course, not all of this sleep time occurred at night. One-month-old babies slept an average of 8 hours each night, with 96% of babies getting between 6 and 13.3 hours of nighttime sleep. At 3 months, babies spent more time sleeping at night—-10 hours, on average."
385,"• the average baby slept about 1.8 hours during the daytime. • 50% of babies slept between approximately 1.3 to 2.3 hours. • 96% of babies slept between 0.7 and 2.9 hours. Elsewhere, naps may be on the decline. Of course, not all of this sleep time occurred at night. One-month-old babies slept an average of 8 hours each night, with 96% of babies getting between 6 and 13.3 hours of nighttime sleep. At 3 months, babies spent more time sleeping at night—-10 hours, on average."
386,"The sleep charts that you see in parenting books and websites are based on how much time parents—typically, Western parents—say their babies spend sleeping. For instance, studies of Australian babies reveal that the average newborn gets about 16-17 hours of sleep over a 24-hour period. Of course, not all of this sleep time occurred at night. One-month-old babies slept an average of 8 hours each night, with 96% of babies getting between 6 and 13.3 hours of nighttime sleep. At 3 months, babies spent more time sleeping at night—-10 hours, on average."
387,"Typical sleep patterns for newborns. Newborns sleep a lot – typically up to 16 to 17 hours a day. But most babies don't stay asleep for more than two to four hours at a time, day or night, during the first few weeks of life. Here are some tips to help your baby settle down to sleep: Set up a sleep schedule. For the first six to eight weeks, most babies aren't able to stay up much longer than two hours at a time. If you wait longer than that to put your baby down, he may be overtired and have trouble falling asleep. Teach your baby the difference between day and night"
388,Sleeping well at 6 weeks was a good indication of more night-time sleep at 9 and 12 weeks. Babies who slept well at night were exposed to significantly more light in the early afternoon period. These data suggest that light in the normal domestic setting influences the development of the circadian system. 
389,"Newborns spend from 16 to 20 hours asleep each day. Between the ages of one and four, total daily sleep time decreases to about 11 or 12 hours. This gradual decline continues through childhood, such that an adolescent will need—though not necessarily get—about nine hours of sleep to function at his or her best. "
390,"Normal Infant Sleep Development. Sleep is a developmental process, and our sleep needs change throughout our lifetimes. Newborn babies may sleep for 18 or so hours a day, but often for only for 2-3 hours at a time. Night-waking is normal during early infancy and healthy babies experience several awakenings per night at the end of sleep cycles. Newborn babies have very small stomachs, and need to feed often, so they wake at least every 2-3 hours in order to do so, sometimes more often."
391,"Finally, newborns vary greatly in the total amount of time they spend sleeping. In the first few days, the average newborn sleeps between 16-18 hours a day (Iglowstein et al 2002). By four weeks, newborn sleep averages about 14 hours. But the range is considerable. Some four-week-old babies sleep as little as 9 out of 24 hours. "
392,"That said, the average basal temperature for humans is 98.6º F. Read on to learn how your body temperature changes during pregnancy and what you can do about it. If you notice a rise in your BBT two weeks after ovulation, chances are high that you have conceived. The rise is however not too high and on average your BBT will only rise by 0.4ºF. If for example your average BBT is 98.6ºF, it would rise to 99ºF and this rise could continue for the first few months of pregnancy. If you do not conceive, your temperature will go down to normal during menstruation."
393,"The average normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature varies throughout the day. In women, body temperature also fluctuates according to hormonal changes that take place during the month and as such provides indication regarding the fertility cycle. If the body temperature of a pregnant woman increases to 100 degrees or more it could be detrimental to the health of the growing baby. Raised body temperature during the first trimester can increase the chances of birth defects in the baby and even cause other complications."
394,"Body Temperature During Pregnancy. If you notice a rise in your BBT two weeks after ovulation, chances are high that you have conceived. This is one of the first signs of pregnancy even before the missed period sign. Although pregnancy affects the BBT, this is only experienced during the first trimester. The rise is however not too high and on average your BBT will only rise by 0.4ºF. If for example your average BBT is 98.6ºF, it would rise to 99ºF and this rise could continue for the first few months of pregnancy. If you do not conceive, your temperature will go down to normal during menstruation."
395,"It's not uncommon for body temp to elevate from what your normal pre-pregnancy temp was. Elevated levels of progesterone, combined with an increased metabolism, will raise your body temp a little during the entire pregnancy. Temps higher than 100.4 F should be reported to your Dr. For temps 102 F or higher, go to the emergency room. I am 7 weeks pregnant and have and elevated temp for over a week now. Anywhere from 98.9- 100.4. There are variances between the tympanic and rectal with the ear temp being almost always 100.4 in one ear and 99.4 in the other ear."
396,"Although 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is considered a normal body temperature, during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester pregnant women experience slightly higher body temperatures which is considered absolutely normal. If the body temperature of a pregnant woman increases to 100 degrees or more it could be detrimental to the health of the growing baby. Raised body temperature during the first trimester can increase the chances of birth defects in the baby and even cause other complications."
397,"Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period."
398,Is it normal that women who are pregnant have a slightly higher body temperature than non pregnant women? I been kinda sick and was worried. I had 98.7 on the thermometer by mouth and I thought that you usually add 1 to it so that would have been 99.7 but wanted to know if this was a normal temperature while pregnant? 
399,Low body temperature during the first trimester of pregnancy could mean low levels of progesterone which could in turn indicate a risk of miscarriage. If the body temperature of a pregnant woman increases to 100 degrees or more it could be detrimental to the health of the growing baby. Raised body temperature during the first trimester can increase the chances of birth defects in the baby and even cause other complications.
400,"Pregnancy is an exciting yet confusing period for expectant mothers. This is because the body undergoes many changes. A lot of first time mothers are unsure about the body changes to expect and this could lead to a lot of confusion and anxiety. One of the major changes that takes place is a rise in body temperature. The rise is however not too high and on average your BBT will only rise by 0.4ºF. If for example your average BBT is 98.6ºF, it would rise to 99ºF and this rise could continue for the first few months of pregnancy. If you do not conceive, your temperature will go down to normal during menstruation."

455,"The Pentagram is a symbol of a star encased in a circle. Always with 5 points (one pointing upward), each has its own meaning. The upward point of the star is representative of the spirit. The other four points all represent an element; earth, air, fire, and water. All these things contibutite to life and are a part of each of us. The ratio of the distance between two points of a pentagram to its total width is in the golden proportion, as is the ratio of the height above the horizontal bar to that below, as is the ratio of a central part of a line to the outer part."
456,"Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling and crystallization (solidification) of magma. 1. Magma. Magma is a complex, highly variable mixture of molten rock, dissolved gas and solid crystals. We will briefly discuss each of these components. "
457,As these pockets of magma cool slowly they become igneous rocks. Igneous rocks are also formed when volcanoes erupt. Igneous rocks are formed as the lava cools above ground. The upper 16 km of the Earth’s crust is composed of 95% igneous rock. Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies underground. These rocks are coarse grained.
458,"Extrusive igneous rocks, also known as volcanic rocks, are formed at the crust's surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. Extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. Igneous rock may form with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks. This magma can be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust."
459,"Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Igneous rock may form with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks. This magma can be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust."

Igneous rock may form with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks. This magma can be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust."
461,"Igneous Rocks. Igneous rocks are formed from lava or magma. Magma is molten rock that is underground and lava is molten rock that erupts out on the surface. The two main types of igneous rocks are plutonic rocks and volcanic rocks. Plutonic rocks are formed when magma cools and solidifies underground. Volcanic rocks are formed from lava that flows on the surface of the Earth and other planets and then cools and solidifies. The texture of an igneous rock depends on the size of the crystals in the rock. This tells us if the rock is plutonic or volcanic. When magma cools underground, it cools very slowly and when lava cools above ground, it cools quickly. When magma and lava cool, mineral crystals start to form in the molten rock. Plutonic rocks, which cool slowly underground, have large crystals because the crystals had enough time to grow to a large size."
462,Igneous rocks: Rock that forms when hot molten rock (magma or lava) cools andfreezes solid. Can be intrusive (formed deep in the earth) or extrusive (formed atthe surface of the earth).Magma: Molten rock beneath the Earth’s surfaceMagma chamber: A space below ground filled with magma. 
463,"Any rock that forms from the cooling of magma is an igneous rock. Magma that cools quickly forms one kind of igneous rock, and magma that cools slowly forms another kind. When magma rises from deep within the earth and explodes out of a volcano, it is called lava, and it cools quickly on the surface. Rock formed in this way is called extrusive igneous rock."
464,"Extrusive igneous rock. Extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rock is produced when magma ex its and cools outside of, or very near the Earth's surface. These are the rocks that form at erupting volcanoes and oozing fissures. "
465,An Igneous rock is the product of cooled solidified magma/lava. As magma/lava cools it goes through the process of crystallization which turns it into an igneous rock. The amount of time it takes for an igneous rock to form depends on its location and its composition.

475,"The allele frequency is distinct from the genotype frequency, although they are related, and allele frequencies can be calculated from genotype frequencies. In population genetics, allele frequencies are used to describe the amount of variation at a particular locus or across multiple loci. When considering the ensemble of allele frequencies for a large number of distinct loci, their distribution is called the allele frequency spectrum. If, , and are the frequencies of the three genotypes at a locus with two alleles, then the frequency p of the A-allele and the frequency q of the B-allele in the population are obtained by counting alleles."
476,"4 Pedro J.N. Silva. nnr '= O On the other hand, the expected combined frequency of blood groups A and O is (p r) (1 q) 2nn nE A O  = + = − + and therefore q can be estimated by nn nq A O +'=1−and in a similar way we obtain nn np'= 1− B + O So, p' , q' and r' are Bernstein's 1925 estimators. "
477,"Thus, this entire population consists of 12,258 (6129 X 2) alleles at the blood type locus. To deter mine the allelic frequencies we simply count the number of M or N alleles and divide by the total number of alleles. So the allelic frequency for the M allele will be: f(M) = [(2 x 1787) + 3039]/12,258 = 0.5395 and the frequency for the N allele will be: f(N) = [(2 x 1303) + 3039]/12,258 = 0.4605 By convention one of the alleles is given the designation P and the other q. Thus for the data we presented above, p=0.5395 and q=0.4605. Because we are analyzing all the alleles, the frequencies shoul d sum to 1.0 and p + q = 1. Furthermore, a population is considered by population geneticists to be polymorphic if two alleles are segregating and if the frequency of the most frequent allele is less than 0.99."
478,"For example, refSNP page for rs222 reports: MAF/MinorAlleleCount:G=0.249/542. This means that for rs222, minor allele is 'G' and has a frequency of 24.9% in the 1000Genome phase 1 population and that 'G' is observed 542 times in the sample population of 1088 people (or 2176 chromosomes). 16094233. "
479,"Allele frequency, or gene frequency, is the relative frequency of an allele (variant of a gene) at a particular locus in a population, expressed as a fraction or percentage. Specifically, it is the fraction of all chromosomes in the population that carry that allele. If, , and are the frequencies of the three genotypes at a locus with two alleles, then the frequency p of the A-allele and the frequency q of the B-allele in the population are obtained by counting alleles."
480,"The Hardy-Weinberg equation is a mathematical equation that can be used to calculate the genetic variation of a population at equilibrium. In 1908, G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg independently described a basic principle of population genetics, which is now named the Hardy-Weinberg equation. In addition, the sum of the allele frequencies for all the alleles at the locus must be 1, so p + q = 1. If the p and q allele frequencies are known, then the frequencies of the three genotypes may be calculated using"
481,"Evolution is simply a change in frequencies of alleles in the gene pool of a population. For instance, let us assume that there is a trait that is determined by the inheritance of a gene with two alleles--B and b. In this equation, p is the predicted frequency of homozygous dominant (AA) people in a population, 2pq is the predicted frequency of heterozygous (Aa) people, and q is the predicted frequency of homozygous recessive (aa) ones."
482,"To explore the Hardy-Weinberg equation, we can examine a simple genetic locus at which there are two alleles, A and a. The Hardy-Weinberg equation is expressed as: p 2 + 2pq + q 2 = 1. where p is the frequency of the A allele and q is the frequency of the a allele in the population. In the equation, p 2 represents the frequency of the homozygous genotype AA, q 2 represents the frequency of the homozygous genotype aa, and 2pq represents the frequency of the heterozygous genotype Aa. In addition, the sum of the allele frequencies for all the alleles at the locus must be 1, so p + q = 1. If the p and q allele frequencies are known, then the frequencies of the three genotypes may be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation."

All three types of marble will vary from slab to slab, as no two marble formations are the same. The uniqueness of each marble slab is what can result in distinguished luxury kitchens and baths. "
520,"Various types of stone, in a multitude of colors and textures, are found around the world. Global imports natural stone material from over 20 countries. Much of our granite comes from Brazilian, Indian, African or Chinese quarries. Marble is frequently imported from Italy, Spain and Mexico. Slate is imported from Brazil, India and China, while travertine and limestone come from Spain, Portugal, Mexico and Peru. While the slab cost of 2cm material may be a little less, it may need to be laminated if you choose a more elaborate edge profile, bringing the finished project cost up to the same price as using 3cm material (which doesn’t require lamination)."
521,"Expiration is generally passive because the alveolar pressure has become greater than atmospheric pressure causing air to flow out of the lungs. Intrapleural pressure becomes more negative during inspiration and then becomes less negative during expiration. The resting pressure is around -5 cm H2O and it becomes approximately -8 cm H2O at the end of inspiration. Best Answer: Intrapleural pressure does not stay constant during inspiration and expiration. First though, why it's subatmospheric: the intrapleural space is the space between the lungs and the chest wall. The natural course of things is for to the chest wall to try and expand, while the lungs try to collapse"
522,"During inspiration as the chest wall expands Pip decreases (more negative). During expiration as the chest wall recoils Pip increases (less negative). The air coming into the lung is driven by these pressure gradients. Example with arbitrary numbers. Inspiration: intra-alveolar pressure decreases from 0 to -1 by the action of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. Assuming the atmospheric pressure to be constant, the relationship between intra-alveolar pressure and atmospheric pressure determines whether or not air moves into the lungs. Intrapleural pressure is the pressure within the pleural space."
523,Nope as the collapsing is prevented by the negative pressure of the intrapleural fluid/cavity. Inspiration = Thorax expands-Intrapleural pressure gets more negative-this causes transpulmonary pressure to increase-so the lungs expand and alveolar pressure becomes lower than that of the atmosphere-so air flows in. In pneumothorax the thorax is penetrated so air enters this intrapleural cavity. 
524,"The intraplural pressure becomes more negative simply because as the inspriatory muscles (diaphragm, external intercostals) act to increase thoracic volume, the intrapleural s … pace increases in volume somewhat, thereby decreasing the pressure (Boyle's Law). "
525,"In physiology, intrapleural pressure (also called intrathoracic pressure) refers to the pressure within the pleural cavity. Normally, the pressure within the pleural cavity is slightly less than the atmospheric pressure, in what is known as negative pressure. When the pleural cavity is damaged/ruptured and the intrapleural pressure becomes equal to or exceeds the atmospheric pressure, pneumothorax may ensue. Intrapleural pressure depends on the ventilation phase, atmospheric pressure, and the volume of the intrapleural cavity. At rest we have a negative intrapleural pressure. This gives us a transpulmonary pressure expanding the lungs. Intrapleural pressure is sub-atmospheric"
526,"As the lungs collapse back down, the intrapleural pressure will become more negative (as we saw in Part A, above, at the end of expiration). Intrapleural pressure must be low with respect to ambient air during inspiration in order for ambient air to flow into the alveoli. A) End expiration: At rest, intrapleural pressure must remain slightly negative (here it is shown as -5 mmHg) as i) the lung is elastic and has a tendency to collapse or shrink, and ii) the fluid lining the alveolar surfaces generates surface tension that works to collapse the lung."
527,"Making the world better, one answer at a time. The intraplural pressure becomes more negative simply because as the inspriatory muscles (diaphragm, external intercostals) act to increase thoracic volume, the intrapleural space increases in volume somewhat, thereby decreasing the pressure (Boyle's Law). "
528,"Transpulmonary pressure is the difference between the alveolar pressure and the intrapleural pressure in the lungs. During human ventilation, air flows because of pressure gradients. "
529,"Kidney stones may cause cloudy urine. They can cause pus in the urine, which gives your pee that milky or cloudy look. If you have kidney stones, the pain of the stones may lead you to see a doctor more quickly than the cloudy urine. Some possible cloudy urine causes are: Food can cause a change in the consistency and color of your urine, although they are not the usual cause of cloudy urine. Blood in urine-When the blood is microscopic, it may not show bright red or dark red but rather it may appear as cloudy urine."
530,"A urinary tract infection-a UTI can cause cloudy urine. The urinary tract infection may be accompanied with burning or painful urination. A bladder infection (a more specific type of urinary tract infection), also known as Cystitis, may cause cloudy urine. Some possible cloudy urine causes are: Food can cause a change in the consistency and color of your urine, although they are not the usual cause of cloudy urine. Blood in urine-When the blood is microscopic, it may not show bright red or dark red but rather it may appear as cloudy urine."
531,"Normal urine is clear and has a straw-yellow color. When the urine does not have its characteristic clear appearance, it is often referred to as cloudy, turbid, or foamy urine. Cloudy or foamy urine may occur occasionally due to mild dehydration; when it occurs in the absence of symptoms and goes away rapidly, it is usually of little consequence. Certain conditions can cause excess protein or crystalline substances in the urine, causing it to persistently appear cloudy or foamy. Infections anywhere in the urinary tract can cause blood and pus to appear in the urine, giving it a cloudy appearance. Additionally, many of the numerous causes of blood in the urine can yield a cloudy or murky appearance to the urine due to the presence of blood"
532,"Best Answer: Yellow is NOT a normal color, nor is cloudiness normal. If your urine is yellow, you're dehydrated. The normal color should be clear or perhaps the color of lemonade (just a slight hint of yellow that can't be seen easily). This is a serious condition. The medical community either overlooks the signs of dehydration or else ignores them completely."
533,"Healthy urine is clear and light yellow in color. Urine may appear cloudy for a variety of reasons, some of which are not harmful, such as foaming of the urine that occurs temporarily when urinating rapidly."
534,"Cloudy urine can be caused by a variety of conditions, including vaginal discharge, sexually transmitted diseases, dehydration, certain autoimmune disorders, as well as infection, inflammation, or other conditions of the urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra). Urine may appear cloudy for a variety of reasons, some of which are not harmful, such as foaming of the urine that occurs temporarily when urinating rapidly."

Blood in urine-When the blood is microscopic, it may not show bright red or dark red but rather it may appear as cloudy urine."
538,"Those interested in counseling psychology careers will usually start by earning a four year Bachelor's degree in psychology. In order to start their careers, however, advanced degrees are usually necessary. A number of universities offer Master's and Doctoral degrees in counseling psychology. The curriculum requirements to become a counseling psychologist are typically very similar from one university to the next. In addition to learning the fundamentals of psychology and research methods, future counseling psychologists will also often learn about different therapy and counseling techniques. Counseling psychology is a type of applied psychology that can be used to help people gain control of their feelings. This type of psychology focuses on treating individuals with a variety of different emotional, behavioral, and social problems or disorders."
539,"To become a counseling psychologist, you will usually need at least a master degree in counseling or a doctoral degree in counseling psychology. Those with a master degree can work in many different settings and are typically supervised by a doctoral level psychologist. The best job opportunities will be for counseling psychologists that have a doctoral degree and extensive experience. As of 2015, the counseling psychologist salary for the middle 50 percent of counseling psychologists was between $52,370 and $67,080."
540,"The Path to Becoming a Psychologist. First, you will need a bachelor's degree (4 to 5 years), which teaches the fundamentals of psychology. After that, you will need a master's degree (2 to 3 years), which can qualify you to practice in the field as a case manager, employment specialist, or social worker. But here is a general timeline"
541,"In general, an associate’s or bachelor’s degree is required for addiction counseling, career counseling and life coaching. An associate’s or bachelor’s degree also introduces a person to the wide variety of counseling career choices, which may help you to determine if counseling is the correct career path for you. "
542,"Master's Degree (2 to 3 Years). A master's degree will give you a broad introduction to the field of psychology. You can then use your electives to focus your study in a particular field. Successful graduates of this program often pursue positions in education, government, human services, health care mental health care, and marketing/advertising. But here is a general timeline. First, you will need a bachelor's degree (4 to 5 years), which teaches the fundamentals of psychology. After that, you will need a master's degree (2 to 3 years), which can qualify you to practice in the field as a case manager, employment specialist, or social worker."
543,"A master's degree is the minimum requirement for most psychologist positions, and jobs in some branches of psychology will require you to have a doctorate degree. Upon completion of a doctorate program in psychology, you will be awarded either a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) or Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, www.bls.gov) reported in 2012 that some states will allow you to work as a school psychologist with a master's degree in psychology, but many states now require you to have an education specialist degree such as an Ed.S. in school psychology or a doctoral degree (www.bls.gov)."
544,Step Four: Obtain Licensure. All practicing counseling psychologists are required to be state-licensed. Most states require completion of a doctoral degree and clinical post-doctoral internship and a passing score on the Examination for Professional Practice of Psychology. Some states also require an ethics examination

546,"On Your W-2. Any bonus or award should be included in your W-2 statement provided by your employer at the end of each tax year. The amount will be in Box 1, wages, tips and other compensation, lumped in a total for all your compensation. A bonus will be reported for the year in which it is paid. It will be included in that box with wages and other compensation and not reported separately. If the bonus is in the form of a stock option, for instance, the employer should show the fair market value of the stock at the time of the bonus."
547,"Total gross compensation is the amount an employee receives before any deductions or adjustments. Unlike gross salary, which is the earned hourly or annual wages before deductions, total gross compensation includes tips, bonuses and other benefits employers give employees during the period being reported. This information gives government agencies an accurate picture of the employee's taxable income. Example. If you have an employee who earns $40,000 per year, that $40,000 is her gross annual salary, but it is not her gross total compensation unless she receives no additional pay or benefits."
548,"Total compensation is everything the company provides an employee in exchange for working. It includes base salary, bonuses, benefits, perks and on-site amenities. Total compensation indicates that an employee is making two or three times his base salary. Base salary does not include any bonuses, benefits or perks associated with the job. It increases with raises or adjustments, but remains the yearly or hourly wage paid. Base salary is typically the number you say when people ask you how much you make -- what you are paid."
549,"“Your gross salary is the TOTAL amount of compensation that you receive from your employer. Depending on the type of job that you have, this can include any bonuses, commissions, profit sharing plans, retirement plans and overtime pay. It is not uncommon for employees to make the majority of their compensation from non-base pay” (http://www.ehow.com/info_8165672_base-gross-salary-same.html). Gross Salary Scenario: Gross pay represents wages received. It includes the employee’s base or basic salary and additional earnings and income. If the employee has worked overtime or been the recipient of an incentive bonus, the amounts will appear in his gross salary."
550,Overtime pay..   Most overtime hours are payed 1& 1/2 times your original hourly pay. SO if your payed $10.00 an hour you will be payed $15.00 for every overtime hour. $1 … 2.00 would be $18.00 an hour in overtime pay. $6.50 an hour would be $9.75 an hour overtime rate. Some states have their own policy on overtime pay but the national law is 1 1/2 times your original hourly wage.
551,"Unfortunately it isn’t, and you must include your bonuses on your tax return. This will inevitably increase your adjusted gross income, or AGI—which can potentially increase the amount of tax you owe. You may be wondering if the bonus you receive at work is subject to special tax treatment. Watch this video to learn more about work bonus, and how they affect your Adjusted Gross Income, or AGI. Hello, I’m Scott from TurboTax, with important news for taxpayers who receive bonuses from their employer."
552,"Base Salary. Base salary is what you see on your paycheck. It is the amount per hour or per year that you are paid for performing your job. Base salary does not include any bonuses, benefits or perks associated with the job. It increases with raises or adjustments, but remains the yearly or hourly wage paid. Base salary is typically the number you say when people ask you how much you make -- what you are paid."
553,"1 Added to your weekly base salary plus overtime of $619, your weekly total is now $739. 2  This is your weekly gross pay. 3  For the year, $739 x 52 = $38,428. 4  This is your annual gross pay. 1 Let’s say that you earned a $45 productivity bonus last week, and have been consistently productive and earned that same $45 each week for the past year. 2  Your new totals, then, are $405 + $45 = $450 weekly, and $405 x 52 = $23,400 yearly. 3  In our example, therefore, your weekly gross pay is $450; yearly, it’s $23,400."

It is difficult to give exact cooking times since different shapes and thickness of pasta will take less or more time to cook. To cook pasta properly, pasta needs a lot of water. A too-small pot and too little water encourages the pasta to clump and stick together, thus cooking unevenly.

Semen combines fluid elements from the epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and vas deferens. Each body part plays a key role in semen production. The fluids help the sperm swim towards the egg and keep the sperm nourished during the transit process. The fluid also has clotting properties that make the semen sticky. This ensures that the semen clings inside the vagina long enough for the sperm to travel to the egg. Pain in the lower left section of the abdomen is an indicator that the seminal vesicle is inflamed. A dry orgasm is another symptom that can be caused by problems with the seminal vesicle"

667,"On a world scale The Australian Pelican is found throughout Australia, except in the very dry middle (desert region), Papua New Guinea and parts of Indonesia (eg Sulawesi) and sometimes in New Zealand and some Pacific Islands close to Australia. Pelicans as a whole are big birds with a very large wingspan, large beaks and are very well known One of the reason such a big bird can fly is that its skeleton is very light (10% of their weight)."
668,"The Great White Pelican is also called by other names such as the Eastern White Pelican, Rosy pelican or white pelican. These pelicans are often found in warm fresh water. They inhabit areas of Africa, Asia and Europe. They live primarily in the lakes of Africa with a migratory route across Eastern Europe to Kazakhstan. Others of this species live and breed in the Dante River in Romania. There are 8 living species of pelicans and they are found from tropical to temperate regions. Pelicans most commonly have pale feathers, but a number of species are darker in color. They do not have any feathers on their face, bill or legs and these areas change color during breeding seasons."

694,Cilia: minuscule cilia that envelop the paramecium and are used for locomotion. (These protists are called Ciliates). Contractile Vacuole: cavity of the paramecium that is able to contract. Food Vacuole: cavity of the paramecium responsible for digestion. Micronucleus: one of the important central organelles of a paramecium.
695,"The contractile vacuole is a specialised type of vacuole; vacuoles are found in most cells but not all vacuoles are contractile vacuoles. The contractile vacuole, as its name suggests, expels water out of the cell by contracting. The contraction of the contractile vacuole and the expulsion of water out of the cell is called systole. Water always flows first from outside the cell into the cytoplasm, and is only then moved from the cytoplasm into the contractile vacuole for expulsion."
696,Below the centre of the organism you see the feeding opening. The cilia make a current to sweep in bacteria and other food particles. At the base of the feeding opening the food has been enclosed by a vacuole. Food vacuoles are used to transport the food through the cell. Star-shaped contractile vacuoles or water expelling vesicles are used to balance the amount of water in the cell. Two nuclei bear the genetic information. Food vacuoles and the water expelling vesicles are such organelles. Many ciliates have developed all kinds of very special organelles. Paramecium uses so-called trichocysts: tiny pointed filaments that can be fired at a predator when threatened.

Although contractile vacuoles are common to ciliates, they are rare in parasitic protozoa, which suggests that Balantidium coli has a unique osmoregulatory capacity. Balantidium coli has 2 developmental stages: a trophozoite stage and a cyst stage. Balantidium coli is the only ciliate known to parasitize humans. Ciliates represent a phylum of protozoa characterized, in at least one stage of development, by simple or compound ciliary organelles on the surface of their membranes that are used for locomotion."
699,"Overview [edit]. The contractile vacuole acts to regulate quantity of water in a cell. In freshwater environments the concentration of solutes inside the cell is higher than outside the cell (i.e., the environment is hypotonic). Under these conditions water flows from the environment into the cell by osmosis. The contraction of the contractile vacuole and the expulsion of water out of the cell is called systole. Water always flows first from outside the cell into the cytoplasm, and is only then moved from the cytoplasm into the contractile vacuole for expulsion."
700,"In Paramecium, which has one of the most complex contractile vacuoles, the vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by osmosis from the cytoplasm. After the canals fill with water, the water is pumped into the vacuole. The contraction of the contractile vacuole and the expulsion of water out of the cell is called systole. Water always flows first from outside the cell into the cytoplasm, and is only then moved from the cytoplasm into the contractile vacuole for expulsion."

Species of Paramecium range in size from 50 to 330 micrometres (0.0020 to 0.0130 in) in length. Cells are typically ovoid, elongate, foot-or cigar-shaped. Paramecia were among the first ciliates to be seen by microscopists, in the late 17th century. They were probably known to the Dutch pioneer of protozoology, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, and were clearly described by his contemporary Christiaan Huygens in a letter of 1678."
703,LDL cholesterol sometimes is called “bad” cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. (Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.). HDL cholesterol sometimes is called “good” cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. 
704,"Hardening of the arteries, also called atherosclerosis, is a common disorder. It occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries and form hard structures called plaques. "
705,"Atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, is a condition in which plaque builds up inside the arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium and fibrin (a clotting material in the blood). Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis. Many scientists believe plaque begins to form because the inner lining of the artery, called the endothelium, becomes damaged. Three possible causes of damage to the arterial wall are: 1  Elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. 2  High blood pressure."
706,"1 HDL is believed to remove some of the bad cholesterol from plaque in clogged arteries and transport it back to the liver, where it is eliminated. 2  High blood pressure. 3  Having high blood pressure increases the rate at which arterial plaque builds up. 4  It also hastens the hardening of clogged arteries. 5  Cigarette smoke. "
707,"The sudden blood clot that forms over the rupture then causes a heart attack or stroke. Blocked arteries caused by plaque buildup and blood clots are the leading cause of death in the U.S. Reducing cholesterol and other risk factors can help prevent cholesterol plaques from forming. Occasionally, it can even reverse some plaque buildup. "
708,"Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart and other parts of your body. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body. Atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death"

Plaque buildup in the arteries—called atherosclerosis—causes the arteries to narrow, increasing the risk for heart attack and stroke. But you have the power to prevent, stop, and possibly even reverse plaque buildup with lifestyle changes."
710,"The Power of Food. Certain foods can cause the body to make too much of a waxy substance called cholesterol. Cholesterol can combine with fat, calcium, and other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque then slowly builds up and hardens in the arteries, causing them to narrow. This buildup of plaque, a condition called atherosclerosis, can lead to heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. Saturated fat is a main dietary culprit in the buildup of plaque in the arteries. As a result, experts suggest trying to keep saturated fat to less than 7% of total daily calories. A primary source of saturated fat is animal products."
711,"The artery narrows and blood flow is reduced, thus decreasing the oxygen supply. Often a blood clot forms and blocks the artery, stopping the flow of blood. If the oxygen supply to the heart muscle is reduced, a heart attack can occur. If the oxygen supply to the brain is cut off, a stroke can occur. Many scientists believe plaque begins to form because the inner lining of the artery, called the endothelium, becomes damaged. Three possible causes of damage to the arterial wall are: 1  Elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. 2  High blood pressure."

745,"Gas conversion information: Converting gas use into kWh. Your gas meter may record your gas consumption in hundreds of cubic feet, but your energy company is required to bill you in terms of kilowatt hours (kWh). Follow these steps: 1  Take the current reading of your gas meter and deduct the previous meter reading from it. 2  Take this result and multiply it by 2.83, to convert hundreds of cubic feet to cubic metres. 3  Multiply this result by a correction factor of 1.022640, and then by the value shown on your last gas bill."
746,Best Answer: •Multiply your units used by 2.83 to give you the number of cubic metres of gas used. (If you have a newer metric meter measuring gas in cubic metres you do not need to do this). •Multiply by the temperature and pressure figure (1.02264). This value should be on your bill. 
747,"You can convert you gas reading into KWH with this handy calculator. Whether you pay a standing charge or not, you will be able to work out how much your gas and electricity is costing. Your gas meter probably doesn’t measure KWH’s, so this gas calculator will convert your reading into KWH’s using an average calorific value for the gas you have consumed. Below, you will find a list of the most common types of energy tariff. Just check on your gas and electricity bills for the type of tariff you are on: "
748,Your gas meter will record your gas consumption in either cubic meters or hundreds of cubic feet. You will however pay for gas using a price per kWh. To convert your gas meter readings to kWhs feel free to use our free gas meter reading calculator. It will convert cubic meters to kWhs or hundreds of cubic feet (100ft3) to kWhs. For Gas Meters that record cubic meters (your gas meter will have m3 beside the reading). Enter your usage. To calculate this figure take your current meter reading and deduct the previous reading.
749,Click here for a unit to kWh conversion. Formula used to convert gas meter readings to kilowatt hours (kWh): Electricity meters usually show the amount of electricity you have consumed in kWh and the provider bills you directly for that usage.
750,"To convert the readings on an imperial meter from imperial units to kWh's the company should do the following calculation; (The number of units you've used) X (The metric conversion factor) X (The volume correction factor) X (The calorific value of the gas) divided by 3.6 = kWh's. Step 3. All energy bills are priced in kilowatt Hours (kWh), so your supplier has to do a calculation to turn the numbers on your gas meter (units) into kWh's. The only reliable way to see if they are billing you for the correct type of meter, is to do the same calculation."
751,"Instructions. Check your recent electric bill to see what the last reading was. The reading will be the actual meter reading, not the total of kilowatt hours. Make sure it is not an estimated reading. Check your meter to see what the reading is. If the meter is digital, this will be easy. If it is a dial meter, start on the left and read to the right, one dial for each digit. "
752,"Imperial gas meters. If your meter is an old imperial gas meter, which will measure gas in cubic feet, it will have the words cubic feet or the letters ft 3 shown on the front of the meter. If your meter is a newer metric meter, which measures gas in cubic meters, it will state cubic meters or display M 3 on the front of the meter. "

787,"The pancreas is a digestive organ in the abdomen that lies just  below the stomach. Its primary job is to produce enzymes required  for the digestion and absorption of food. … Enzymes secreted include  lipases that digest fat, proteases which digest  proteins, and amylases which digest starch molecules. As the partially digested food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, digestive juices secreted by the pancreas mix with it. The digestive juice produced in the pancreas contains enzymes that aid in further digesting proteins, carbohydrates and fats, as described by the University of Montana. Liver The liver, the largest organ in the body according to New York State University, occupies the area under the diaphragm"
788,"The pancreas has two main functions. The exocrine cells produce digestive enzymes to assist in digestion and the endocrine cells produce hormones to control metabolism. Pancreatic enzymes produced by acinar cells help to digest proteins, carbohydrates and fats."
789,"1. Proteases Digestion of proteins is initiated by pepsin in the stomach, but the bulk of protein digestion is due to the pancreatic proteases. Several proteases are synthesized in the pancreas and secreted into the lumen of the small intestine. Three major groups of enzymes are critical to efficient digestion: 1. Proteases."
790,"Digestive Enzymes Produced by the Pancreas. Pancreatic enzymes are essential for digestion of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Although not as well known as the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, the pancreas is an integral part of the digestive system. It is also one of the most protected organs in your body. Trypsin and chymotrypsin digest the large protein macromolecules into smaller peptides. Two other proteases produced by the pancreas, carboxypeptidase and elastase, further break down the partially digested protein into dipeptides and tripeptides."
791,"While the pancreas produces insulin, insulin is a hormone not a digestive enzyme. The enzymes secreted by the pancreas are proteases, lipase, trypsin and amylase. As the partially digested food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, digestive juices secreted by the pancreas mix with it. The digestive juice produced in the pancreas contains enzymes that aid in further digesting proteins, carbohydrates and fats, as described by the University of Montana. Liver The liver, the largest organ in the body according to New York State University, occupies the area under the diaphragm"
792,"The main enzymes produced by the pancreas are amylase, which is important in the digestion of carbohydrates (foods like bread and potatoes), trypsin which digests protein (from meat, cheese, milk and pulses like beans), and lipase, which digests fat. The pancreas produces chemicals called enzymes which are essential to the digestion of food. These enzymes break down food into very small particles that the body can then absorb. Enzymes are produced in small glands in the pancreas and then flow through the organ into the first part of the bowel."
793,"The pancreas has an endocrine function because it releases juices directly into the bloodstream, and it has an exocrine function because it releases juices into ducts. Enzymes, or digestive juices, produced by the pancreas are secreted into the small intestine to further break down food after it has left the stomach. The gland also produces the hormone insulin and secretes it into the bloodstream in order to regulate the body's glucose or sugar level. "
794,"Pancreatic lipase: Pancreatic lipase is an enzyme (more specifically, a lipase) secreted from the pancreas that uses hydrolysis to break apart fat molecules. Pancreatic amylase: Amylase is the name given to glycoside hydrolase enzymes that break down starch into maltose molecules.

Timber rattlesnakes are protected in Kansas, Maryland, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin"
796,"Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus of the subfamily Crotalinae (pit vipers). The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies, all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and southern British Columbia in Canada to Central Argentina. Rattlesnakes are predators that live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as birds and rodents."
797,"The timber rattlesnake occurs in the eastern and central United States. Minnesota is on the northwestern periphery of its range, which extends north along the Mississippi River from Illinois to Minnesota. Surveys for timber rattlesnakes in Minnesota have been funded and coordinated by a collaborative effort of the Minnesota DNR Nongame Wildlife Program (NWP), Division of Parks, and Minnesota Biological Survey for almost 20 years.

802,"Goats are ruminant animals and they have a stomach that is composed of 4 compartments and ruminants are less likely to experience digestive problems (acidosis) if they are consuming high forage diets. What do goats eat differs from other ruminants such as cattle or sheep. Goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything and they may sample many things, but goats prefer to browse on the tips of woody shrubs, trees, and leafy plants. Stripping leaves off of branches and shrubs is their favorite thing to do. Goats will also eat dry leaves, shoots, weeds, grasses, and apples."
803,"Now that you know the basics of what do goats eat, it is still important to note that changing your goat’s diet rapidly can cause the bacteria inside their body to be thrown off."
804,"In answer to the question, What do goats eat? goats eat both meat and plant-based food items. Commercially raised livestock need to have regular meals comprised of grains (energy,) proteins, vitamins and minerals."
805,"You can read all the literature on what do goats eat but if you skip on other food sources for your goat, then you will miss the boat on the profit that you can potentially make in the process of raising them. There are several food sources that you can add to your goat’s diet such as the following:"
806,"Goats are attracted to natural products, so they tend to nibble on things like wood, or wicker, but won’t eat things like a tire. It’s been my experience that if a goat is well-fed and has complete nutrition, they won’t be a goat that eats everything in site."
807,"Goats don’t really get their nutrition from their food, but rather, from the fermentation of their food. You see, their stomachs – there are 4 of them – are designed to ferment and break down their food and then their body digests the nutrition from their fermented food. Goats are not grazers that will mow your lawn."

Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.
815,"What is Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a virus that can cause liver cancer and can be prevented through a vaccine. Hepatitis B can cause short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) infection in the liver. Chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver, also known as cirrhosis, or can lead to liver cancer. Approximately 1.25 million people in the United States have chronic hepatitis B infection. The presence of these antibodies can tell your doctor or healthcare provider if you have been exposed to hepatitis B, if you have a chronic infection, or if you have previously received the hepatitis B vaccine."
816,"No. Once you recover from Hepatitis A, you develop antibodies that protect you from the virus for life. An antibody is a substance found in the blood that the body produces in response to a virus. Antibodies protect the body from disease by attaching to the virus and destroying it. People who have ever had a serious allergic reaction to the Hepatitis A vaccine or who are known to be allergic to any part of the Hepatitis A vaccine should not receive the vaccine.

859,"Integration of the viral DNA results in permanent insertion of the viral genome into the host chromosomal DNA, referred as a provirus in the case of retroviruses or prophage in the case of prokaryotic viruses. "
860,"Endogenous retroviruses are always in the state of a provirus. When a (nonendogenous) retrovirus invades a cell, the RNA of the retrovirus is reverse-transcribed into DNA by reverse transcriptase, then inserted into the host genome by an integrase. Proviruses may account for approximately 8% of the human genome in the form of inherited endogenous retroviruses. A provirus not only refers to a retrovirus but is also used to describe other viruses that can integrate into the host chromosomes, another example being adeno-associated virus."
861,"Integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into a host cell chromosome is an essential step in the retroviral replication cycle (Varmus et al. 1989; Coffin et al. 1997). Once integrated, the proviral DNA is replicated along with cellular DNA during cycles of cell division, as with any cellular gene. Integration occurs precisely at the termini of the viral DNA but integration can take place at many locations in the host genome. Most positions in chromosomal DNA can serve as integration acceptor sites, but there are distinct regional preferences that differ among groups of retroviruses."
862,"Cells have membranes that prevent DNA from simply diffusing in or out. This is the initial barrier that scientists must overcome in order to insert foreign DNA into a cell. The four ways of accomplishing this goal are transduction, transformation, transfection and injection. Transduction is the insertion of foreign DNA into a cell via a virus (See Reference 1 and 2). Viruses are made of a protein coat that houses DNA within. Viruses can bind to living cells and inject their DNA. Or, viruses can push into the host as a membrane-bound vesicle, before releasing their DNA inside the host. The use of recombinant DNA technology can insert foreign DNA into host cells that are then purposefully infected with viruses"
863,"Integration of Viral DNA. Once the viral RNA has been reverse-transcribed into a strand of DNA, the DNA can then be integrated (inserted) into the DNA of the lymphocyte. The virus has its own enzyme called integrase that facilitates incorporation of the viral DNA into the host cells DNA. "
864,"Transduction is the process by which DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another by a virus. It also refers to the process whereby foreign DNA is introduced into another cell via a viral vector. The excised DNA is then packaged into a new virus particle, which then delivers the DNA to a new bacterium, where the donor genes can be inserted into the recipient chromosome or remain in the cytoplasm, depending on the nature of the bacteriophage."
865,"A provirus is a virus genome that is integrated into the DNA of a host cell. In the case of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages), proviruses are often referred to as prophages. Proviruses may account for approximately 8% of the human genome in the form of inherited endogenous retroviruses. A provirus not only refers to a retrovirus but is also used to describe other viruses that can integrate into the host chromosomes, another example being adeno-associated virus."
866,"Some bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) may undergo lysogeny following infection of host cells. In this case, the viral genome is integrated into host-cell chromosomes, forming a prophage that is replicated along with the host genome. When suitably activated, a prophage enters the lytic cycle (see Figure 6-19). This association is called lysogeny, and the integrated phage DNA is referred to as a prophage (Figure 6-19). Under certain conditions, the prophage DNA is activated, leading to its excision from the host-cell chromosome and entrance into the lytic cycle. Bacterial viruses of this type are called temperate phages."
867,"More generally, transduction is the process by which genetic material, e.g. DNA or siRNA, is inserted into a cell by a virus. Common techniques in molecular biology are the use of viral vectors (including bacteriophages), electroporation, or chemical reagents that increase cell permeability. The excised DNA is then packaged into a new virus particle, which then delivers the DNA to a new bacterium, where the donor genes can be inserted into the recipient chromosome or remain in the cytoplasm, depending on the nature of the bacteriophage."
868,"This is why the serum albumin test can tell your physician how well your liver is working. An albumin test is often used as part of a test known as a liver panel, which tests your blood for albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and prealbumin. Your physician will likely order an albumin test if he or she suspects you may have a condition that affects your liver function. If your liver and/or kidneys are not working well, serum albumins won’t be at their normal levels. With a simple blood test, your doctor can find out your albumin levels and interpret what your levels may mean for your health."
869,"A normal amount of albumin in your urine is less that 20 mg a day. A normal total protein amount in your urine is less that 150 mg a day. If your test shows high levels of urine albumin, or a rise in urine albumin, it could mean you have kidney damage or disease. This test looks for a protein called albumin in your urine. The test is used to check for kidney damage or disease. Albumin helps to keep the right amount of fluid moving through your body."
870,"The normal range of albumin levels is 3.4- 5.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL). There might be a marginal difference in the ranges in different laboratories. Low albumin levels are indicative of liver disease and further enzyme tests will be required to pinpoint which one it is. Tweet. Albumin is a protein manufactured by the liver. It helps balance the amount of blood flowing through the arteries and veins and moves the calcium, progesterone, bilirubin and medications through a person’s blood. It also stops fluid in the blood from leaking into the tissues."
871,"Proteins circulate throughout your blood to help your body maintain fluid balance. Albumin is produced in the liver, and is one of the most abundant proteins in your blood’s fluid or plasma. A proper balance of albumin is required to keep fluid from leaking out of blood vessels. If your liver and/or kidneys are not working well, serum albumins won’t be at their normal levels. With a simple blood test, your doctor can find out your albumin levels and interpret what your levels may mean for your health."
872,"The serum albumin test also can test the status of certain medical conditions, such as chronic pancreatitis, liver disease, or kidney disease. If you have one of these conditions, serum albumin results can indicate if your condition is improving or advancing. If your liver and/or kidneys are not working well, serum albumins won’t be at their normal levels. With a simple blood test, your doctor can find out your albumin levels and interpret what your levels may mean for your health."
873,"Albumin is routinely included in the panels of tests performed as part of a physical, such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) , so it is frequently assessed as a part of an evaluation of a person's overall health status. Low albumin levels can reflect diseases in which the kidneys cannot prevent albumin from leaking from the blood into the urine and being lost. In this case, the amount of albumin or protein in the urine also may be measured (see Urine Albumin)."
874,"Guide. An albumin test checks urine for a protein called albumin. Albumin is normally found in the blood and filtered by the kidneys. When the kidneys are working as they should, there may be a very small amount of albumin in the urine. But when the kidneys are damaged, abnormal amounts of albumin leak into the urine."

894,"In one of the examples before, we had kelp as a pro ducer. The kelp is eaten by fish such as the halfmoon fish, a fish called the opalaye, and clown fish. Therefore, the opaleye fish, the halfmoon fish, and the clown fish are all primary consumers. Plankton is eaten by whales, which filter the plankton by its teeth. Whales are then a primary consumer. Seaweed is also eaten by crabs, making them a primary consumer. IF primary consumers were taken out of the food chain, the food chain would not be able to manage along. Instead of energy source.

1048,"Estuaries. Estuaries are bodies of water formed where freshwater from rivers or streams connect with salt ocean water. The mixed water is called brackish, and the salinity may fluctuate dramatically for example depending on freshwater input from rains and waves and tides influences from the ocean. Depending on the amount of influence from freshwater and marine inputs and the circulation of water, different estuaries are divided up into different categories. A salt wedge estuary is the simplest type, occurring at a river mouth where the river flows directly into the ocean."
1049,"Good to Meet You. An estuary is a coastal area where freshwater from rivers and streams mixes with saltwater from the ocean. Estuaries are protected from the full force of the ocean by mudflats, sandspits and barrier islands. You'll find estuaries all over the world and there are lots of different names for them. There are lots of different types of habitats in and near estuaries. Freshwater and salt marshes, sandy beaches, mud and sand flats, mangrove forests, river deltas, tidal pools and swamps can all be part of the estuary."
1050,"Old Woman Creek is a freshwater estuary located on the south-central shore of Lake Erie in Ohio. Tidal changes in water level only average about 3 cm. As a storm-driven estuary system, during periods of low water flow, a barrier sand beach will often close the mouth of the estuary, isolating it from Lake Erie. Unlike brackish estuaries that are tidally driven, freshwater estuaries are storm-driven. In freshwater estuaries the composition of the water is often regulated by storm surges and subsequent seiches (vertical oscillations, or sloshing, of lake water). While the Great Lakes do exhibit tides, they are extremely small."
1051,"We normally think of estuaries as places where rivers meet the sea, but this is not always the case. Freshwater or Great Lakes-type estuaries do not fit the definition of a brackish water estuary where freshwater and seawater mix. Freshwater estuaries are semi-enclosed areas of the Great Lakes in which the waters become mixed with waters from rivers or streams. Unlike brackish estuaries that are tidally driven, freshwater estuaries are storm-driven. In freshwater estuaries the composition of the water is often regulated by storm surges and subsequent seiches (vertical oscillations, or sloshing, of lake water).

1052,"Estuaries are bodies of water along our coasts that are formed when fresh water from rivers flows into and mixes with salt water from the ocean. In estuaries, the fresh river water is blocked from streaming into the open ocean by either surrounding mainland, peninsulas, barrier islands, or fringing salt marshes. Well-mixed estuary: This type forms where rivers input smaller amounts of fresh water and the tidal range is moderate to high (Figure 1b). Whereas in the salt-wedge type there is a strong salinity gradient from surface to bottom, in the well-mixed type salinity is more constant from surface to bottom."
1053,"Learn about estuaries: the areas where fresh water and the sea meet. slide 1 of 1. Most of us understand the difference between fresh water, such as those in rivers and streams and the salt water of the ocean. But, since these rivers of fresh water run into the sea of salt water, they must meet somewhere; that meeting place is known as an estuary. Typically, a fresh water source such as a river runs into a body of water near the coast that is some what contained similar to a lake but just as it has a source running into it, an estuary also has an exit with a open route to"

Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments. An estuary is a dynamic ecosystem with a connection with the open sea through which the sea water enters with the rhythm of the tides. The sea water entering the estuary is diluted by the fresh water flowing from rivers and streams."

1126,"Although dairy foods generally contain the most concentrated amounts of calcium, many other foods are good sources of calcium. Here are some food ideas and the amount of calcium they contain: Dairy foods. 1  1 cup of milk - 291-302 mg. 2  1 cup of yogurt - 345-415 mg. 3  1 ounce of American cheese - 174 mg. Dairy foods generally contain the most concentrated amounts of calcium. The calcium is not contained in the fat portion of dairy products, so removing the fat (as in low-fat dairy foods) does not affect the calcium content."
1127,"Foods high in calcium include milk, yogurt and beverages with calcium added such as soy beverages, orange juice, and rice beverages. Cheese is also a good source of calcium. For other foods, check the label. Calcium has been added if you see 'fortified' or 'enriched' on the label. Very few foods have vitamin D in them. Foods with a higher amount of vitamin D include fish, liver, and egg yolk. Excellent sources of vitamin D are foods and beverages that have vitamin D added to them. Cow milk always has added vitamin D. Orange juice, margarine, and soy beverage usually have it added."

1130,"Vegans should eat foods that are high in calcium and/or use a calcium supplement. Our bones contain large amounts of calcium, which helps to make them firm and rigid. Calcium is also needed for other tasks including nerve and muscle function and blood clotting. However, other excellent sources of calcium exist. Sources of well-absorbed calcium for vegans include calcium-fortified soy milk and juice, calcium-set tofu, soybeans and soynuts, bok choy, broccoli, collards, Chinese cabbage, kale, mustard greens, and okra."

1133,"Smoke Smell Removal. There’s something about vinegar that gets rid of smoke smell. Because the smell of smoke is caused by the leftover resins and tars, vinegar (an acid that cuts through resin and tar) is a great way to clean those surfaces that aren’t made of fabric, and perhaps, some that are fabric. If it doesn’t have a cleaning agent in it, you’re not going to get rid of the smoke smell. Scent-generating deodorizers only serve to mask the smell.

1143,"Genetic diversity. Definition. noun. Genetic diversity refers to both the vast numbers of different species as well as the diversity within a species. The greater the genetic diversity within a species, the greater that species' chances of long-term survival. This is because negative traits (such as inherited diseases) become widespread within a population when that population is left to reproduce only with its own members"
1144,"1 Both plant species diversity and genetic diversity within a plant species can affect community properties and ecosystem processes. 2  However, the relative contribution of species diversity and genetic diversity to ecosystem functioning is poorly known. Summary. 1 "
1145,"Populations or species with low genetic diversity at many genes are at risk. When diversity is very low, all the individuals are nearly identical. If a new environmental pressure, such as a disease, comes along, all of the individuals within the population may get the disease and die. To measure the genetic diversity of a particular gene, scientists look at how many different versions of it (called alleles) are present in a population. For example, one gene may determine the flower color of a plant. Different alleles may exist for that gene (e.g., a pink allele, a purple allele, and a white allele)."
1146,"Biodiversity is the variety of different types of life found on Earth and the variations within species. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity."
1147,"Genetic diversity is the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species. It is distinguished from genetic variability, which describes the tendency of genetic characteristics to vary. Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. Diversifying selection is the hypothesis that two subpopulations of a species live in different environments that select for different alleles at a particular locus. This may occur, for instance, if a species has a large range relative to the mobility of individuals within it."
1148,"Genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is the variety of genes within a species. Each species is made up of individuals that have their own particular genetic composition. This means a species may have different populations, each having different genetic compositions. To conserve genetic diversity, different populations of a species must be conserved. Genes are the basic units of all life on Earth. They are responsible for both the similarities and the differences between organisms."
1149,"Furthermore, the loss of genetic diversity within a species can result in the loss of useful and desirable traits (e.g. resistance to parasites). Reduced diversity may eliminate options to use untapped resources for food production, industry and medicine. In contrast, the reduction and extinction of populations is far easier to see. Extinction is not only the loss of whole species, but is also preceded by a loss of genetic diversity within the species. This loss reduces the species ability to perform its inherent role in the whole ecosystem."
1150,Genetic diversity refers to the variety of genes within a species. Each species is made up of individuals that have their own particular genetic composition. Within a species there may also be discrete populations with distinctive genes. 
1151,"Biodiversity is the variety of all living things; the different plants, animals and micro organisms, the genetic information they contain and the ecosystems they form. Biodiversity is usually explored at three levels-genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity. To conserve genetic diversity, different populations of a species must be conserved. Genes are the basic units of all life on Earth. They are responsible for both the similarities and the differences between organisms."
1152,"Asclepius was usually shown in a standing position, dressed in a long cloak, holding a staff with a serpent coiled around it. The staff has since come to represent medicine's only symbol. In the Caduceus, used by physicians and the Military Medical Corp., the staff is winged and has two serpents intertwined."
1153,"Despite learned opinion that it is the single snake staff of Asclepius that is the proper symbol of medicine, many medical groups have adopted the twin serpent caduceus of Hermes or Mercury as a medical symbol during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."
1154,"The caduceus is often mistakenly used as a symbol of medicine and medical practice (especially in North America), due to historical confusion with the traditional medical symbol, the rod of Asclepius."
1155,"The Caduceus, which has two snakes and a pair of wings. The caduceus. The caduceus is often incorrectly used as a symbol for medicine or doctors, in place of the rod of Asclepius which is the usual symbol of the medical profession."
1156,"The winged version is known as a caduceus, andthe stick is actually a staff that was carried by the Olympian god Hermes. In Greek mythology, Hermes was a messenger between the gods and humans (which explains the wings) and a guide to the underworld (which explains the staff)."
1157,"Another, earlier depiction of the medical symbol is the staff of Asclepius, thought it has no wings and only one snake. The son of Apollo and the human princess Coronis, Asclepius is the Greek demigod of medicine. According to mythology, he was able to restore the health of the sick and bring the dead back to life."
1158,This is a good question. There are two symbols which are often used in the medical profession to refer to medicine. These are the Caduceus (the winged staff of Hermes entwined with two snakes) and the Rod of Asclepius (A rod with one snake coiled around it in the process of shedding its skin).
1159,"Many medical organisations use a symbol of a short rod entwined by two snakes and topped by a pair of wings, which is actually the caduceus or magic wand of the Greek god Hermes (Roman Mercury), messenger of the gods, inventor of (magical) incantations, conductor of the dead and protector of merchants and thieves."

1170,"The Germans had little choice — few other places besides the United States allowed German immigration. Unlike the Irish, many Germans had enough money to journey to the Midwest in search of farmland and work. The largest settlements of Germans were in New York City, Baltimore, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Milwaukee. In the decade from 1845 to 1855, more than a million Germans fled to the United States to escape economic hardship. They also sought to escape the political unrest caused by riots, rebellion and eventually a revolution in 1848."
1171,"It is the largest ethnic group comprising about 50 million people, making them the largest self-reported ancestry group in the United States, ahead of Irish Americans, African Americans, English Americans, Mexican Americans and Italian Americans. They comprise about 1⁄3 of the German diaspora in the world. German-Americans are somewhat better educated and more white collar than the general population, with one-third having at least a bachelor's degree and about 40 percent are employed in management, business, science or the arts."
1172,"Introduction. The United States experienced major waves of immigration during the colonial era, the first part of the 19th century and from the 1880s to 1920. Many immigrants came to America seeking greater economic opportunity, while some, such as the Pilgrims in the early 1600s, arrived in search of religious freedom. Individual states regulated immigration prior to the 1892 opening of Ellis Island, the country’s first federal immigration station. New laws in 1965 ended the quota system that favored European immigrants, and today, the majority of the country’s immigrants hail from Asia and Latin America."
1173,"Immigration continued in very large numbers during the 19th century, with eight million arrivals from Germany. In the middle half of the nineteenth century (between 1820 to 1870) over seven and a half million immigrants came to the United States — more than doubling the entire population of the country. German-Americans are somewhat better educated and more white collar than the general population, with one-third having at least a bachelor's degree and about 40 percent are employed in management, business, science or the arts."
1174,"We are a nation of immigrants. Successive waves of immigrants have kept our country demographically young, enriched our culture and added to our productive capacity as a nation, enhancing our influence in the world. Immigration gives the United States an economic edge in the world economy. Immigrants bring innovative ideas and entrepreneurial spirit to the U.S. economy. They provide business contacts to other markets, enhancing America’s ability to trade and invest profitably in the global economy. Immigrants are not a drain on government finances. The NAS study found that the typical immigrant and his or her offspring will pay a net $80,000 more in taxes during their lifetimes than they collect in government services. For immigrants with college degrees, the net fiscal return is $198,000."
1175,"The first permanent German settlements in Texas date back to the early 1830's, and the upsurge in German immigration in the 1840's resulted in such towns as Fredericksburg and New Braunfels. By the mid 1850's, the populations of San Antonio, Houston, and Galveston were about one-third German. In the decade from 1845 to 1855, more than a million Germans fled to the United States to escape economic hardship. They also sought to escape the political unrest caused by riots, rebellion and eventually a revolution in 1848."

1177,"Mexico is the birthplace of 28% (or 11.6 million) of all immigrants in the U.S. Immigrants born in Mexico account for more than half of all of the foreign born in five states: New Mexico (72%), Arizona (58%), Texas (58%), Idaho (53%) and Oklahoma (51%). After Germany, the largest share of immigrants in the U.S. came from Russia and the countries that would become the USSR (11%, or 1.5 million). Since 1965, when Congress passed legislation to open the nation’s borders, immigrants have largely hailed from Latin America and Asia."
1178,"Immigration patterns of the 1930s were dominated by the Great Depression. In the final prosperous year, 1929, there were 279,678 immigrants recorded, but in 1933, only 23,068 came to the U.S. In the early 1930s, more people emigrated from the United States than to it. While immigration has increased drastically over the last century, the foreign born share of the population was still higher in 1900 (about 20%) than it is today (about 10%). A number of factors may be attributed to the decrease in the representation of foreign born residents in the United States."

1193,"A phenotype (from Greek phainein, meaning to show, and typos, meaning type) is the composite of an organism 's observable characteristics or traits, such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, phenology, behavior, and products of behavior (such as a bird's nest). The genotype of an organism is the inherited instructions it carries within its genome. This genotype-phenotype distinction was proposed by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's heredity and what that heredity produces."
1194,"A phenotype results from the expression of an organism's genes as well as the influence of environmental factors and the interactions between the two. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorph.

1201,Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) has emerged as a powerful detection technique due to its high sensitivity and label-free capability. This optical-based real-time detection method delivers superior results across diverse categories of research. 
1202,The principle of Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is an optical detection process that occurs when a polarized light hits a prism covered by a thin (gold) metal layer. 
1203,"The plasmon can be considered a quasiparticle since it arises from the quantization of plasma oscillations, just like phonons are quantizations of mechanical vibrations. Thus, plasmons are collective (a discrete number) oscillations of the free electron gas density, for example, at optical frequencies. Plasmons play a large role in the optical properties of metals and semiconductors. Light of frequencies below the plasma frequency is reflected by a material because the electrons in the material screen the electric field of the light."

In addition, a central vacuum reduces allergies and is quiet, versatile, and cost effective: most homeowners recoup their investment once the home is sold. To learn more about the benefits of installing a central vacuum system in your home, see Seven Reasons to Install a Central Vacuum."
1275,"1 Certain brands of central vacuums can use the Hide-A-Hose system, which installs a retractable hose in each inlet (the vacuum's suction pulls the hose into the pipes when no longer needed). 2  This can increase the total cost by $350-$500 or more per Hide-A-Hose inlet. 1 Vacuum bags can cost $5-$50 for a three-pack, depending on make and model, but average about $10-$20. 2  A cloth sock for the vacuum hose (to prevent scratching furniture or flooring) can cost $10-$30, depending on length."

1277,"The contribution margin, sometimes used as a ratio, is the difference between a company's total sales revenue and variable costs. In other words, the contribution margin equals the amount that sales exceed variable costs. This is the sales amount that can be used to, or contributed to, pay off fixed costs. "
1278,"For example, if you have variable costs of $10,000 to produce 1,000 units, then the variable cost per unit is $10. Step 2. Calculate the contribution margin per unit of each product by subtracting the variable costs per unit from the unit-selling price -- that is the price you sell a single unit for. For instance, with a variable cost per unit of $10 and a unit-selling price of $20, the contribution margin per unit would be $10. Step 3. "
1279,"Product Revenue-Product Variable Costs Product Revenue. The phrase contribution margin can also refer to a per unit measure of a product's gross operating margin, calculated simply as the product's price minus its total variable costs. "
1280,"Confidence votes 4.0K. For example, if the per-unit variable cost is $15 and selling price per unit is $20, then the contribution margin is equal to $5. The contribution margin may provide a $5 contribution toward the reduction of fixed costs or a $5 contribution to profits. "
1281,"Example of Contribution Margin. Suppose that a company is analyzing its revenues and expenses. The company has sales of $1,000,000 and variable costs of $400,000. The contribution margin for this example would be the difference of $1,000,000 and $400,000, which is $600,000. The $600,000 is the amount left over to pay fixed costs."
1282,"Contribution Margin Ratio | Contribution Margin Formula. The contribution margin ratio is the difference between a company's sales and variable expenses, expressed as a percentage. The total margin generated by an entity represents the total earnings available to pay for fixed expenses and generate a profit"
1283,"Contribution Margin. Contribution margin is a product’s price minus all associated variable costs, resulting in the incremental profit earned for each unit sold. The total contribution margin generated by an entity represents the total earnings available to pay for fixed expenses and to generate a profit. To determine the contribution margin, s ubtract all variable costs of a product from its revenues, and divide by its net revenue. Product variable costs typically include, at a minimum, the costs of direct materials and sales commissions."
1284,"Contribution margin (CM) is the amount by which sales revenue exceeds variable costs. It can be calculated as contribution margin per unit as well as total contribution margin, using the following formulas: Unit CM = Unit Price − Variable Cost per Unit. Total CM = Total Sales − Total Variable Costs."

At 10 months of age, you will think you have fully-colored panther chameleon. The full-blown colors don’t come out until about 18 months. On average, chameleons can live up to 7-8 years with good care. Some panthers can live much longer and are the exception to this rule. Long-lived chameleons are generally fed nutritious gut-loaded crickets with less dependence on powdered supplements."

1299,"Male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length, with a typical length of around 17 in (45 cm). Females are smaller, at about half the size. In a form of sexual dimorphism, males are more vibrantly colored than the females. Panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months. When gravid, or carrying eggs, females turn dark brown or black with orange striping to signify to males they have no intention of mating. The exact coloration and pattern of gravid females varies depending on the color phase of the chameleon."

1315,"Active voice is used in a clause whose subject expresses the agent of the main verb. That is, the subject does the action designated by the verb. A sentence whose agent is marked as grammatical subject is called an active sentence. In contrast, a sentence in which the subject has the role of patient or theme is named a passive sentence, and its verb is expressed in passive voice. Active voice is a grammatical voice common in many of the world's languages. It is the unmarked voice for clauses featuring a transitive verb in nominative–accusative languages, including English and most other Indo-European languages"
1316,"1 When a verb is in the active voice, the subject of the sentence is also the doer of the action.  2 The sentence 'John picked up the bag' is in the active voice because the subject, John, is also the thing or person doing the action of 'picking up.'. 1 Use the following three steps to write in the active voice: 1. Locate the action (verb) of the sentence.2. 2  Locate who or what is doing the action. 3  This is the doer (subject) of the sentence. 4  If the doer is implied and not written in or is being acted on by the action, the sentence is weak or passive"

No.   Additional Info: According to the IUCN Red List, there are only two Barnacle species listed out of what is generally believed to around 900 species living today."
1332,"As the barnacle larvae are so tiny, they float around with the plankton in the water. Once the barnacle is older and has it's tough outer shell, few predators can actually eat it. Humans are known to eat goose barnacles (the only edible species of barnacle) in parts of Europe like Spain and Portugal. Barnacles are often seen on crabs, whales, boats, rocks and on the shells of sea turtles. Although some species of barnacle are parasitic, most barnacle species are harmless, because they are filter feeders and do not interfere with an animal's normal diet and do not harm that animal that they live on in any way."
1333,"Barnacle is a small but a hardy saltwater animal belonging to Arthropoda phylum along with being put in the class Crustacea and the order Cirripedia. Barnacles are usually found attached to ships, rocks, wharves, marine animals and to other hard surfaces. Acorn barnacle, Brown Buckshot barnacle, Goose barnacle and Thatched barnacle are some common types of barnacle. Barnacles are closely related to lobsters and crabs as they too have a hard outer cover. "
1334,"Description [edit]. Barnacles are encrusters, attaching themselves permanently to a hard substrate. The most common, acorn barnacles (Sessilia), are sessile, growing their shells directly onto the substrate. The order Pedunculata ( goose barnacles  and others) attach themselves by means of a stalk. Barnacles are exclusively marine, and tend to live in shallow and tidal waters, typically in erosive settings. They are sessile (nonmotile) suspension feeders, and have two nektonic (active swimming) larval stages. Around 1,220 barnacle species are currently known. The name Cirripedia is Latin, meaning curl-footed"
1335,"Goose barnacles (order Pedunculata), also called stalked barnacles or gooseneck barnacles, are filter-feeding crustaceans that live attached to hard surfaces of rocks and flotsam in the ocean intertidal zone. "
1336,"Barnacles feed on plankton they sweep from the water with their fan-like feet. Their main predators are whelks --snails that envelop the barnacle's cone and force the valves open. The blue mussel is a competitor for space, possibly outgrowing and smothering barnacles. That's where barnacles live, peeking out only when water covers them so they can filter food into their homes. This barnacle zone is the highest of the intertidal zones. Although they may look like mollusks with their shell-like covering, barnacles are actually crustaceans, related to lobsters, crabs and shrimp. They look like tiny shrimp in their larval stage, where they swim as members of zooplankton in the ocean"
1337,"Barnacles attach themselves to animals when they are very young and in the larvae stage of their lives. Once the baby barnacle has effectively glued itself to something hard, a thin layer of flesh wraps around the barnacle and an outer shell is produced. Barnacles are often seen on crabs, whales, boats, rocks and on the shells of sea turtles. Although some species of barnacle are parasitic, most barnacle species are harmless, because they are filter feeders and do not interfere with an animal's normal diet and do not harm that animal that they live on in any way."
1338,"Sprinting uses the same muscles as running, but requires that they are considerably more limber for short bursts of speed while avoiding injury. Running is powered by the legs, hips and glutes, so training the same muscles with a focus on speed will prepare you for sprinting. While training, avoid raising on the toes or pumping too high with the arms. Allow the primary muscles used for running to provide the power to sprint. The quadriceps are the muscles at the front of the thighs. These muscles raise the leg and propel the runner forward. Muscles throughout your body work in coordinating pairs."

In the animal cell, they are the main power generators, converting oxygen and nutrients into energy."
1379,"Cilia are also responsible for locomotion in some much larger organisms, such as flatworms (Platyhelminthes). These animals secrete a film of mucus, then creep through it on numerous cilia. This is called mucociliary locomotion. For a microscopic crustacean or an amoeba, however, movement through water is like crawling through molasses. There are three types of locomotion commonly employed by tiny aquatic organisms. One is amoeboid motion, which is used by its namesake Amoeba and some other protozoans, as well as by white blood cells."

In eukaryotes, mature mRNA molecules must leave the nucleus and travel to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located. The next phase in translation is known as the elongation phase (Figure 6). First, the ribosome moves along the mRNA in the 5'-to-3'direction, which requires the elongation factor G, in a process called translocation."
1419,"Ribosomes are the sites in a cell in which protein synthesis takes place. Cells have many ribosomes, and the exact number depends on how active a particular cell is in synthesizing proteins. For example, rapidly growing cells usually have a large number of ribosomes (Figure 5). Within the ribosome, the rRNA molecules direct the catalytic steps of protein synthesis — the stitching together of amino acids to make a protein molecule. In fact, rRNA is sometimes called a ribozyme or catalytic RNA to reflect this function."

Each ribosome is divided into two subunits: 1. a smaller subunit which binds to a larger subunit and the mRNA pattern, and 2. a larger subunit which binds to the tRNA, the amino acids, and the smaller subunit. When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule, these two subunits split apart. Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. Ribosomes consist of two major components: the small ribosomal subunit, which reads the RNA, and the large subunit, which joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain."

One fraction is synthesized from the runoff MG by T7 RNA polymerase (input RNA), and the other fraction results from the replication of the antigenomic RNA by Lassa virus polymerase. An inhibitory effect of Z protein was previously demonstrated with the LCMV and Tacaribe virus replicon systems (12, 32). We therefore wondered whether a similar effect is also observed in the Lassa virus replicon system. Various amounts of pCITE-Z were cotransfected with pCITE-NP, pCITE-L, and genomic MG DNA or RNA."
1428,"Lassa virus (LASV) is an arenavirus that causes Lassa hemorrhagic fever, a type of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), in human and non-human primates. Lassa virus is an emerging virus and a select agent, requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment. The well-known Lassa fever is mostly caused by the Lassa virus. The symptoms include flu-like illness characterized by fever, general weakness, cough, sore throat, headache, and gastrointestinal manifestations."
1429,"Abstract. We describe the isolation and characterization of a new Lassa virus strain imported into Germany by a traveler who had visited Ghana, Cote Côte'D, ivoire And Burkina. Faso this, strain DESIGNATED, av originated from a region In West africa Where lassa fever has not been. reported Virus RNA was isolated from 140 µL of serum or cell culture supernatant of Lassa virus and LCMV-infected Vero and L cells, respectively, by using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions (elution of RNA in 50 µL of buffer)."
1430,"The arenavirus Lassa virus causes Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in the countries of Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea and perhaps elsewhere in West Africa. "
1431,"Construction of plasmids for expression of Lassa virus proteins. Lassa virus strain AV, which had been previously isolated from a patient with fulminant Lassa fever (24), was selected as a basis for the replicon system. An inhibitory effect of Z protein was previously demonstrated with the LCMV and Tacaribe virus replicon systems (12, 32). We therefore wondered whether a similar effect is also observed in the Lassa virus replicon system. Various amounts of pCITE-Z were cotransfected with pCITE-NP, pCITE-L, and genomic MG DNA or RNA."
1432,"This is excluded in the Lassa virus system as well as in the RNA polymerase I-based LCMV system. Another difference from existing systems concerns the expression of the MG. The Lassa virus replicon was only functional with runoff MG transfected as DNA or RNA. An inhibitory effect of Z protein was previously demonstrated with the LCMV and Tacaribe virus replicon systems (12, 32). We therefore wondered whether a similar effect is also observed in the Lassa virus replicon system. Various amounts of pCITE-Z were cotransfected with pCITE-NP, pCITE-L, and genomic MG"
1433,"Lassa fever causes hemorrhagic fever frequently shown by immunosuppression. Replication for Lassa virus is very rapid, while also demonstrating temporal control in replication. The first replication step is transcription of mRNA copies of the negative-or minus-sense genome. The well-known Lassa fever is mostly caused by the Lassa virus. The symptoms include flu-like illness characterized by fever, general weakness, cough, sore throat, headache, and gastrointestinal manifestations."
1434,"Lassa viruses are enveloped, single-stranded, bisegmented, ambisense RNA viruses. Their genome is contained in two RNA segments that code for two proteins each, one in each sense, for a total of four viral proteins. The well-known Lassa fever is mostly caused by the Lassa virus. The symptoms include flu-like illness characterized by fever, general weakness, cough, sore throat, headache, and gastrointestinal manifestations."
1435,"Lassa fever or Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus and first described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria. Lassa fever is a member of the Arenaviridae virus family. Outbreaks of the disease have been observed in Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the Central African Republic. The primary animal host of the Lassa virus is the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), an animal found in most of sub-Saharan Africa."
1436,"All hemorrhagic fever viruses have single-stranded RNA genomes, which differ in polarity and in the number of segments (flaviviruses: positive-sense, 1 segment; filoviruses: negative-sense, 1 segment; arenaviruses: negative-sense, 2 segments; bunyaviruses: negative-sense, 3 segments). For example, many cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Lassa or yellow fever are mild and go unrecognized, but Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever is almost always a severe disease, in which the case fatality rate ranges from 50-90%."

1444,"The word pericardium literally means 'about' or 'around' (peri-) the 'heart' (cardia). This layer is composed of three membranous layers that encircle the exterior of the heart: the outer fibrous pericardium, the parietal pericardium, and the inner epicardium (also referred to as the visceral pericardium)."
1445,"The endocardium is the most inner layer of the heart. It forms the inner layer of all four heart chambers and is directly connected to all the inner cardiac appendages, such as the bicuspid valve, the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve, the aortic valve, the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles."
1446,"Each layer is specialized in its structure and function. Thus, all three layers function together to ensure proper functioning of the heart and to ensure that it pumps blood properly to all the organs in the body."
1447,The epicardium is the layer of muscle found covering the external surfaces of the heart. It is directly fused with the myocardium internally and is in contact with the serous layer of the pericardium. It is sometimes considered as a division of the inner
1448,"Lesson Summary. The heart wall is composed of three main layers: the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The pericardium (which is formed by the fibrous pericardium, the parietal pericardium and the epicardium) forms the outermost protective layer."
1449,2. Myocardium-Cardiac muscle layer is the bulk of the heart: this is the thick layer of cardiac muscle which is responsible for the contraction and relaxation of the ventricles and atria. 3. Endocardium-the inner lining of the heart (lines chambers and valves). *Pericardium-.
1450,"The heart's outer wall consists of three layers. The outermost wall layer, or epicardium, is the inner wall of the pericardium. The middle layer, or myocardium, contains the muscle that contracts."
1451,"The myocardium is the middle muscular layer of the heart's walls and it functions by providing a scaffolding for the heart chambers, assisting in contraction and relaxation of the cardiac walls so that blood can pass between the chambers and electrostimulation conduction through its own tissues and into the epicardium."
1452,"Definition. Infant jaundice is a yellow discoloration in a newborn baby's skin and eyes. Infant jaundice occurs because the baby's blood contains an excess of bilirubin (bil-ih-ROO-bin), a yellow-colored pigment of red blood cells."
1453,"Jaundice is a condition that can occur in newborns within 2-3 days of birth. Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes. This is caused by elevated bilirubin levels in the newborn’s blood. Jaundice normally appears first on the face and then will move down the body to the chest, abdomen, arms, and legs. Bilirubin is a substance created by the normal breakdown of red blood cells. It is processed and removed by the liver. Jaundice will develop when a baby’s liver is not efficient enough to remove the bilirubin from the bloodstream."
1454,"Types of Jaundice in Newborns. Jaundice in newborns, which produces a yellow color to the skin and eyes, is caused by a buildup of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). In the womb, a fetus obtains nutrients and eliminates by-products, such as bilirubin, through the umbilical cord. After birth, the baby's organs take over these jobs. "
1455,"Blood Group Incompatibility (Rh or ABO problems). If a baby and mother have different blood types, sometimes the mother produces antibodies that destroy the newborn's red blood cells. This causes a sudden buildup of bilirubin in the baby's blood. This type of jaundice usually begins during the first 24 hours of life. Rh problems are now preventable with an injection of RhoGAM to the mother within 72 hours after delivery. This prevents her from forming antibodies that might endanger subsequent babies. Breastfeeding Jaundice. Breastfeeding jaundice occurs in 5% to 10% of newborns. It's caused by insufficient intake of breast milk (calories and fluid). It follows the same pattern as physiological jaundice."
1456,"Jaundice may result from serious disorders, such as incompatibility of the newborn’s and mother’s blood type, excessive breakdown of red blood cells, or a severe infection. If jaundice develops in a newborn, parents should call their doctor right away. If jaundice is caused by a disorder, that disorder is treated. Breastfeeding jaundice is common. It develops in 1 of 6 breastfed infants a few days after birth. It occurs in newborns who do not consume enough breast milk (often because the mother's milk has not yet come in well). Newborns who consume less breast milk have fewer bowel movements and thus eliminate less bilirubin."
1457,"Often, physiologic jaundice -- the type seen in most newborns -- does not require aggressive treatment. It will typically disappear in a few days with frequent feedings and exposure to indirect sunlight at home. Doctors may test the baby 's bilirubin levels during that time to make sure it has not gotten worse. "
1458,"Physiologic Jaundice. Physiologic Jaundice is the most common and normal type of jaundice in babies. It can affect up to 60% of full term babie s in the first week of life, and it is caused by elevated bilirubin levels. Bilirubin is a substance created by the normal breakdown of red blood cells. It is processed and removed by the liver. Jaundice will develop when a baby’s liver is not efficient enough to remove the bilirubin from the bloodstream."
1459,Jaundice is a yellow tint to a newborn's skin and the white part of the eyes. It is a sign that there's too much bilirubin in the baby's blood. The word for having too much bilirubin in the blood is hyperbilirubinemia (say hy-per-bil-ih-roo-bih-NEE-mee-uh). Jaundice usually appears in the first 5 days of life. Many babies have left the hospital by the time jaundice starts. So your doctor may want to do a follow-up exam when your baby is 3 to 5 days old. Most babies have mild jaundice.
1460,"In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow. Jaundice is common in newborns. It occurs when the level of bilirubin (a yellow pigment produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells) in the blood rises. Breastfeeding jaundice is common. It develops in 1 of 6 breastfed infants a few days after birth. It occurs in newborns who do not consume enough breast milk (often because the mother's milk has not yet come in well). Newborns who consume less breast milk have fewer bowel movements and thus eliminate less bilirubin."
1461,"When this occurs, the mother’s blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborn’s blood cells and cause jaundice. The risk of this is highest near or during delivery. A-B-O incompatibility occurs when: 1  the mother is type O and the baby is B, A, or AB. 2  the mother is type A and their baby is B or AB. "

1538,"Weathering Process The weathering process occurs when rocks are exposed to the hydrosphere (water) and atmosphere (air). These weathering agents can change the physical and chemical characteristics of rocks. Physical Weathering Physical weathering occurs when rocks are broken in to smaller pieces without changing the chemical composition of the rock. Think of a physical change (e.g., ripping a piece of paper) where the sample will change in size but all its other characteristics will remain the same."
1539,"Spheroidal weathering is a form of chemical weathering that affects jointed bedrock and results in the formation of concentric or spherical layers of highly decayed rock within weathered bedrock that is known as saprolite. Spheroidal weathering is the result of chemical weathering of systematically jointed, massive rocks, including granite, dolerite, basalt and sedimentary rocks such as silicified sandstone. It occurs as the result of the chemical alteration of such rocks along intersecting joints."
1540,"Physical weathering is also known as mechanical weathering. This type of weathering occurs when rocks and other landforms are broken down by physical factors in the environment. These physical factors include wind, water, sun, ice and temperature changes. This type of weathering does not change the chemical composition of the rock or minerals. Weathering is different from erosion. Erosion is the movement of rock pieces and sediment from one area to another. Weathering is the breaking down of rocks and erosion is a wearing away of rocks. There are two main types of weathering: physical (or mechanical) weathering and chem"
1541,There are three basic types of chemical reactions that cause four types of chemical weathering of rocks. Dissolution and hydrolysis are caused by reactions with acids. Hydration is the absorption of water. Oxidation is reaction with oxygen. 1. 
1542,"Weathering is the chemical and physical processes that change the characteristics of rocks on the Earth s surface. It is also known as the preparation for erosion. In order for weathering to occur, the environment of a rock sample must change and the rock needs to be exposed to some form of water and the air. Physical Weathering Physical weathering occurs when rocks are broken in to smaller pieces without changing the chemical composition of the rock. Think of a physical change (e.g., ripping a piece of paper) where the sample will change in size but all its other characteristics will remain the same."
1543,(a) Chemical Weathering results from chemical reactions between minerals in rocks and external agents like air or water. Oxygen oxidizes minerals to alteration products whereas water can convert minerals to clays or dissolve minerals completely. 
1544,"Chemical Weathering. Chemical weathering is caused by rain water reacting with the mineral grains in rocks to form new minerals (clays) and soluble salts. These reactions occur particularly when the water is slightly acidic. These chemical processes need water, and occur more rapidly at higher temperature, so warm, damp climates are best. Chemical weathering (especially hydrolysis and oxidation) is the first stage in the production of soils."
1545,"Chemical weathering can also result from exposure to water. Hydrolysis occurs when silicate minerals react with water so that the mineral recombines with the water molecule to form a new mineral. For example, consider the mineral potassium feldspar. Chemical weathering refers to the processes by which rocks react with the atmosphere to form new substances. These reactions can alter a rock and transform the rock into sand, clays, and other minerals. CHEMICAL WEATHERING.

1662,"Dopamine does not cross the blood–brain barrier, so its synthesis and functions in peripheral areas are to a large degree independent of its synthesis and functions in the brain. A substantial amount of dopamine circulates in the bloodstream, but its functions there are not entirely clear. Most types of reward increase the level of dopamine in the brain, and a variety of addictive drugs increase dopamine neuronal activity. Other brain dopamine systems are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones."
1663,"In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter —a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells.

Other brain dopamine systems are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones."
1664,"Types of immunizations Immunization can occur in one of two forms. Active immunization involves stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies to fight a disease. This is the form of immunization used in creating vaccines. Passive immunization involves providing an antibody to the patient. It provides only temporary protection against disease. Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (DTaP). Protects against diphtheria (serious throat infection), tetanus (severe nerve disease) and pertussis (respiratory illness sometimes known as “whooping cough”). DTaP is provided in a series of five injections from ages 2 months to 6 years."
1665,"Types of vaccines. The way in which the body responds to a vaccine depends on the type of vaccine being administered. There are several different types of vaccine available and with new technology there will be further additions. In order to produce an immune response, live attenuated vaccines must replicate (grow) in the vaccinated person. A relatively small dose of virus or bacteria is given, which replicates in the body and creates enough virus/bacteria to stimulate an immune response."
1666,"For example: 1  Some travelers to less-developed countries get the vaccine to prevent typhoid fever. 2  There are live and killed forms of this vaccine. 3  Rabies is a viral infection that is 100 percent fatal once it has progressed. 4  The disease is simply too dangerous to give, even in a weakened state. If scientists can make a killed vaccine that is effective, that is what they will do. It's all about trial and error.. Most viral diseases, he says, require live-attenuated vaccines, but the vast majority of bacterial illnesses are prevented with inactivated vaccines. There are some exceptions to this rule, though."
1667,"The smallpox vaccine used cowpox, a poxvirus that was similar enough to smallpox to protect against it but usually didn’t cause serious illness. Rabies was the first virus attenuated in a lab to create a vaccine for humans. Vaccines are made using several different processes. Human papillomavirus (HPV). Live, attenuated vaccines currently recommended as part of the U.S. Childhood Immunization Schedule include those against measles, mumps, and rubella (via the combined MMR vaccine), varicella (chickenpox), and influenza (in the nasal spray version of the seasonal flu vaccine)."
1668,"Vaccines have contributed to a significant reduction in many childhood infectious diseases, such as diphtheria, measles, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Some infectious diseases, such as polio and smallpox, have been eliminated in the United States due to effective vaccines. Vaccines work by preparing the body’s immune system for future attacks by a certain disease, caused by either viruses or bacteria. Vaccines contain weakened bacteria or viruses, or parts of bacteria or viruses, and mimic these disease-causing agents (which are called antigens)."
1669,"A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing micro-organism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The rate of side effects depends on the vaccine in question. Some common side effects include: fever, pain around the injection site, and muscle aches. Additionally, some individuals may be allergic to ingredients in the vaccine."
1670,"In addition to live, attenuated vaccines, the immunization schedule includes vaccines of every other major type—see the table above for a breakdown of the vaccine types on the recommended childhood schedule. The different vaccine types each require different development techniques. Human papillomavirus (HPV). Live, attenuated vaccines currently recommended as part of the U.S. Childhood Immunization Schedule include those against measles, mumps, and rubella (via the combined MMR vaccine), varicella (chickenpox), and influenza (in the nasal spray version of the seasonal flu vaccine)."
1671,"Killed or Inactivated Vaccines. One alternative to attenuated vaccines is a killed or inactivated vaccine. Vaccines of this type are created by inactivating a pathogen, typically using heat or chemicals such as formaldehyde or formalin. Human papillomavirus (HPV). Live, attenuated vaccines currently recommended as part of the U.S. Childhood Immunization Schedule include those against measles, mumps, and rubella (via the combined MMR vaccine), varicella (chickenpox), and influenza (in the nasal spray version of the seasonal flu vaccine)."
1672,"Classification of vaccines​. There are two basic types of vaccines: live attenuated and inactivated. The characteristics of live and inactivated vaccines are different, and these characteristics determine how the vaccine is used. Live attenuated vaccines are produced by modifying a disease-producing (“wild”) virus or bacteria in a laboratory. In order to produce an immune response, live attenuated vaccines must replicate (grow) in the vaccinated person. A relatively small dose of virus or bacteria is given, which replicates in the body and creates enough virus/bacteria to stimulate an immune response."
1673,"(Dr. Jenner called this process vaccination after the Latin word for cow, vacca.). Today there are several types of vaccines. Some, such as the oral polio vaccine (OPV), are live, attenuated vaccines which means the virus has been weakened so that it stimulates antibody production, but does not cause the disease. "

1724,"The plague bacteria can be transmitted to humans in the following ways: Flea bites. Plague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics, many rodents die, causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. If these bacteria-containing droplets are breathed in by another person they can cause pneumonic plague. Typically this requires direct and close contact with the person with pneumonic plague. Transmission of these droplets is the only way that plague can spread between people."

1794,"If you eat cured meats, you've probably encountered sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite. Sodium nitrate is a salt that is often added to jerky, bacon and luncheon meats. Sodium nitrite, on the other hand, is a salt and antioxidant that is commonly used to cure ham and bacon. Both chemicals act as food preservatives and add a red or pink color to processed meats, among other uses. "
1795,"Hobbyist gold refiners use sodium nitrate to make a hybrid aqua regia that dissolves gold and other metals. Sodium nitrate is also a food additive used as a preservative and color fixative in cured meats and poultry; it is listed under its INS number 251 or E number E251. It is approved for use in the EU, USA and Australia and New Zealand. A mixture of sodium nitrate, calcium nitrate and potassium nitrate is used as energy storage material in prototype plants, such as Andasol Solar Power Station and the Archimedes project."
1796,"Sodium nitrate, a preservative that's used in some processed meats, such as bacon, jerky and luncheon meats, could increase your heart disease risk. It's thought that sodium nitrate may damage your blood vessels, making your arteries more likely to harden and narrow, leading to heart disease. "

1821,"It’s not just the pastor who has a responsibility to the church, but the church also has a responsibility to their pastor and his family. Paul requested of the Thessalonians, “Appreciate those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction” (1 Thessalonians 5:12 NASB). "
1822,"Ask God to bless you in such a way that you can bring great glory to Him. Ask God not to give you any temporal blessing that won’t give Him glory. Ask God to bless you in such a way that peoples who have never praised the only living and true God might do so. We need to say with Jesus, “Lord God, if this blessing is not going to lead to your glory, don’t give it to me!”. So Psalm 67 and indeed all the Bible emphasizes that God blesses His people for the glory of His own name, so that His goodness, mercy, and love would be recognized and praised by men and angels."
1823,"God has a better plan for you-He has created you to do good works-not to curse others. Your actions need to be determined-not by the response of the other person-but in focused obedience on what God wants you to do. When you bless those who curse you, you show you are not a slave to that other person's behavior. When people say and do hurtful things, God has a plan for our response. These four steps in Luke 6:27-28 are only the beginning of what God says in the Bible, but they will provide most of us with a fulltime challenge of putting them into practice."
1824,"If your employer is adamant that you sign an agreement, you should at least negotiate with them a shorter period of time in which you have to pay back any money to give you more flexibility.

1840,"The process of respiration produces energy for organisms by combining glucose with oxygen from the air. During cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen are changed into energy and carbon dioxide. Therefore, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere during the process of cellular respiration. glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energy. Respiration is also the process by which once-living (organic) organisms are decomposed. When organisms die, they are decomposed by bacteria. Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere or water during the decomposition process. Carbon dioxide is also released when organisms breathe. Respiration also takes place at the cellular level. All plants and animals return both carbon dioxide and water vapor to the atmosphere. Every cell needs to respire to produce the energy it needs."

Green plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Living organisms-including all plants and animals-release energy from their food using respiration. Respiration and combustion-burning-both release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These processes form a carbon cycle in which the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere remains about the same. The animation should help you to understand how the cycle works
1843,"carbon cycle. carbon cycle, in biology, the exchange of carbon between living organisms and the nonliving environment. Inorganic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is converted by plants into simple carbohydrates, which are then used to produce more complex substances. Animals eat the plants and are then eaten by other animals. Animals and some microorganisms require the carbon-containing substances from plants in order to produce energy and as a source of materials for many of their own biochemical reactions; this cycle is vital to them. The process of incorporating carbon dioxide into the molecules of living matter is called fixation."

1859,"Two types of sclerenchyma cells exist: fibres and sclereids. Their cell walls consist of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Sclerenchyma cells are the principal supporting cells in plant tissues that have ceased elongation. Sclerenchyma fibres are of great economic importance, since they constitute the source material for many fabrics (e.g. flax, hemp, jute, and ramie). Parenchyma forms the filler tissue in the soft parts of plants. Collenchyma cells have thin primary walls with some areas of secondary thickening. Collenchyma provides extra structural support, particularly in regions of new growth. Sclerenchyma cells have thick lignified secondary walls and often die when mature."
1860,"Sclerenchyma is a specialised tissue, adapted to withstand both compressive and tensile stresses in plants. Sclerenchyma cell types may be divided into fibres, associated with phloem, xylem and other tissues; and sclereids or varied kinds. Sclereids originate from parenchyma and expand by intrusive growth."
1861,"Phloem and xylem fibres in trees originate from the vascular cambium through delicately controlled, parallel cell divisions. Sclerenchyma cells have secondary wall layers that are constructed from cellulose microfibrils in a matrix of hemicelluloses and lignin. Sclerenchyma cell types may be divided into fibres, associated with phloem, xylem and other tissues; and sclereids or varied kinds. Sclereids originate from parenchyma and expand by intrusive growth."
1862,"The vascular tissue system is composed of the xylem (transport of water and dissolved minerals) and phloem (transport of food-usually sucrose and other sugars-, nitrogen containing compounds, and hormones). The xylem and phloem in the primary plant body are usually closely associated in the form of vascular bundles. "
1863,"In vascular plants, phloem is the living tissue that carries organic nutrients (known as photosynthate), in particular, sucrose, a sugar, to all parts of the plant where needed. In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Greek word φλοιός (phloios) meaning bark. "
1864,"Sclerenchyma Mature sclerenchyma is composed of dead cells with extremely thick secondary walls cell walls composed of cellulose and lignin: these walls make up to 90% of the whole cell volume. Sclerenchyma tissue is a supporting tissue. There are two types of sclerenchyma cells, fibres and sclereids. Fibres are generally long, slender cells, which commonly occur in strands or bundles, and can be seen in the diagram below as dense red caps to the outside of the vascular tissue. "
1865,The protective/supportive sclerenchyma include fibers and sclereids. The vascular sclerenchyma is xylem. Vascular tissues of plants contain xylem and phloem. Xylem cells usually stand out as sclerenchyma cell types whereas phloem cells blend in with other parenchyma. The next two units present more information about xylem and phloem. Sclerenchyma cells in this view are fibers or xylem. Note the thick secondary cell walls and large lumens of the xylem cells to the right. Contrast these to the smaller diameter fiber cells with thick walls to the upper left. You should note most sclerenchyma cells are dead at maturity and therefore lack nuclei.
1866,"Typical Life Expectancy. On average, owners can anticipate Staffordshire Terriers to live between 9 and 15 years. However, all members of the breed are indeed individuals with different medical circumstances, so these numbers often greatly vary. Some Staffordshire Terriers may live less than 9 years, while others may surpass 15 years by a mile."
1867,"Dog Size. Research shows that larger dogs live for a shorter period of time when compared to smaller ones. For example, an Irish Wolfhound (average 115 lbs) has an average lifespan of 7 years, while a Jack Russell Terrier (average 15 lbs) can live up to 13-16 years. Chihauhuas are normally referred to as the breed with the longest lifespan. They average 15-20 years and are one of the smallest dog breeds. The oldest Chihuahua on record 1, Megabyte, died at the age of 20 years and 265 days."
1868,"The life expectancy of the Yorkshire Terrier is between is between 12 to 15 years with a median age of 13.5 years. Female Yorkies live-on average - 1.5 years longer than males. Since this is such a threat to the life span of the Yorkshire Terrier, moderate to severe cases are treated with surgery. Over 50% of dogs that have shunts severe enough to cause clinical signs and changes to behavior will die in one year without this surgical procedure."
1869,"Report Abuse. Cairn Terriers make wonderful pets for all ages of family members and with proper care, which includes a healthy diet (making sure to keep them trim and fit), exercise and lots of love, they have an average life span of 12-15 years with many living longer.

1870,"The average life span of a Boston Terrier is around 11 and 15 years. The life span all depends according to the general health, diet, and living conditions of the individual dog. "
1871,"There are 2 main reasons why this breed does have a life span that is longer than the national average: 1) Toy breeds life longer than medium and large breed dogs. 2) The Yorkshire Terrier is a rather healthy breed. The majority of health issues that Yorkies contend with are not fatal. Since this is such a threat to the life span of the Yorkshire Terrier, moderate to severe cases are treated with surgery. Over 50% of dogs that have shunts severe enough to cause clinical signs and changes to behavior will die in one year without this surgical procedure."
1872,"The Rat Terrier life expectancy is about 25 years. Well, the long life span of Rat Terrier will never make you feel lonely and keep your house lively. The average Rat Terrier life span is about 15 - 18 years. With good dog care you can extend the life span of Rat Terrier to over 25 years. Many experts even say the Rat Terrier life expectancy is just 13 to 16"

Asking which planet is the closest to Earth is actually something of a trick question – the closest planet to Earth can change depending on the day, month, or even year."
1874,"Venus is the answer to ”what is the closest planet to Earth”. It is similar in diameter, mass, and volume, but you can see how it is a scary world compared to ours. There are several missions headed to Venus. Only the Sun and the Moon are brighter. When Venus is closest to Earth it is only 38 million km away. When Venus and Earth are at their closest approach to each other, it is called opposition.

1876,"The planet that can be closest to Earth when we're both in the same part of our orbits is Venus. The minimum distance between us and Venus is about 25.5 million miles, or about 28% of the distance from earth to the sun. ======================================. While we're on the subject, this is also a good time to mention Mars. After Venus, Mars is the next nearest planet to Earth. So the distance between Earth and any other planet changes over a wide range, depending on whether we're both on the same side of the sun or on opposite sides. At any given time, the planet closest to Earth could be either Mercury, Venus, or Mars."
1877,Save. Venus is the closest planet to Earth and second closest to the sun. It was named after the Roman goddess of love and is often referred to as Earth's sister planet because of their similar size and composition. The atmosphere of Venus is filled with clouds of carbon dioxide and the surface is a dry desert.

1879,"Venus may be the closest planet to our own, but no one has ever been able to visualize its surface. The sulfur content of the clouds reflects nearly all visible light, preventing visual observation below the edges of the atmosphere. What knowledge scientists have gained about the surface has come from radar imaging. Only the Sun and the Moon are brighter. When Venus is closest to Earth it is only 38 million km away.

1880,"Since every planet has its own orbit around the Sun, and every orbit is a different length, all planets have different periods that would signify a year (or a complete orbit of the Sun). When Venus is in the middle of the Sun and Earth, it is at its closest point to Earth. During this period, Venus would be the closest planet to Earth. However, there are times when Mars is actually the closest planet. For example, during August 2003, Earth and Mars were at such a point in their orbits that Mars was at one of its closest distances to Earth. Asking which planet is the closest to Earth is actually something of a trick question – the closest planet to Earth can change depending on the day, month, or even year.

1882,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A project management office, abbreviated to PMO, is a group or department within a business, agency or enterprise that defines and maintains standards for project management within the organization. The PMO strives to standardize and introduce economies of repetition in the execution of projects. The PMO is the source of documentation, guidance and metrics on the practice of project management and execution. There are many reasons for such failures. As per a PwC survey of 1,524 organizations, inadequate project estimating and planning constitutes 30% of project failures, lack of executive sponsorship constitutes 16% and poorly defined goals and objectives constitutes 12%."

Your PMO might be a central function reporting to the Board, or it might be a department within a division. You may have a hub-and-spoke model with a central PMO and divisional units in different locations. The PMO might even be a temporary team, put together to support a large program."

1918,The Mauna Loa Volcano is the largest volcano on the planet as it rises over 4 kilometers above the sea level but the 4 kilometers that you see on top is not even half the size of the volcano. The Mauna Loa Volcano is not only a big size; it is also one of the most active volcanoes in the world. Since the first documented eruption in 1843 there have been an additional 32 eruptions.
1919,"Mauna Loa, or Long Mountain in Hawaiian, is located on the island of Hawaii. It is pictured above rising 13,680 ft. (4,170 m) above sea level (this photo was taken from over Loihi seamount, some 30 km or so to the south). Since 1832, Mauna Loa has erupted 39 times; its last eruption was in 1984. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory celebrated the 30th anniversary of Mauna Loa's last eruption (in 1984) on March 25, 2014, underscoring that it has been a realtively quite 3 decades at the world's largest active volcano."
1920,"Articles. Mauna Loa is the largest volcano on Earth with an estimated volume of 9,600 cubic miles (40,000 cubic kilometers). It makes half of the area of the Island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa began to form nearly a million years ago. There is a caldera, Mokuaweoweo, at the summit and rift zones extend to the northeast and southwest. Mauna Loa is in the shield-building stage and is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth, erupting 15 times since 1900. "
1921,"Mauna Loa (which means long mountain in Hawaiian) is one of the world's great peaks. It's the largest active volcano, and one of the most energetic. Its dramatic bulk comprises half of the island of Hawaii (the Big island), which it shares with several fellow volcanoes. Mauna Loa is also one of the most active of the world's volcanoes. Its last major eruption was in 1984, and vulcanologists expect another blow. Around 98 percent of the peak is blanketed in lava flows under 10,000 years old."
1922,"At 1 million to 700,000 years of age, Mauna Loa is the second youngest of the five volcanoes on the island, making it the third youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia. It is an active shield volcano with relatively gentle slopes, with a volume estimated at approximately 18,000 cubic miles (75,000 km 3), although its peak is about 120 feet (37 m) lower than that of its neighbor, Mauna Kea. Lava eruptions from Mauna Loa are silica-poor and very fluid, and they tend to be non-explosive"
1923,"Mauna Loa's most recent eruption occurred from March 24 to April 15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the volcano have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, and the city of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late 19th century.

Its long submarine flanks descend to the sea floor an additional 5 km, and the sea floor in turn is depressed by Mauna Loa's great mass another 8 km. This makes the volcano's summit about 17 km (56,000 ft) above its base! "
1925,"Mauna Loa, a shield volcano, is not a super volcano. A super volcano is a volcano marked by the inordinately massive nature of its eruption. There are a number of candid … ates for the super volcano list made up of areas in the U.S. (and around the world), and Hawaii is not on it. "

Mauna Loa is about 55,770 feet (17,000 meters) from its base beneath the ocean to the summit, which is 13,681 feet (4,170 meters) above sea level. It is also one of the Earth’s most active volcanoes and is carefully monitored. "
1927,"The word in the garden is that basil is good to have around. Plants are known to communicate with each other via shade, aromatic chemicals, and physical touch, promoting processes such as growth and defense against disease, as well as attraction of bees and other pollinators."
1928,"The forest really does hum with life. Though often too low or too high for human ears to detect, insects and animals signal each other with vibrations. Even trees and plants fizz with the sound of tiny air bubbles bursting in their plumbing. And there is evidence that insects and plants hear each other's sounds."
1929,"As mentioned earlier, plants also communicate with other plants—even with plants of other species—through a complex underground network that includes: 1  The plants' rhizosphere (root ball). 2  Aerial emissions (volatile gasses emitted by the plants). 3  Mycelial networks in the soil."
1930,"And plants may use sound to communicate with one another. If even bacteria can signal one another with vibrations, why not plants, said Monica Gagliano, a plant physiologist at the University of Western Australia in Crawley. Sound is overwhelming, it's everywhere."
1931,"Suzanne Simard, forest ecologist at the University of British Columbia, and her colleagues have made the major discovery that trees and plants really do communicate and interact with each other. She discovered an underground web of fungi connecting the trees and plants of an ecosystem."
1932,Plants may have their own language that allows them to communicate with each other by sharing genetic information. This language could be what helps weeds when they take over other plants.
1933,"For example, we now know that plants are capable of communicating with each other via extensive and complex networks, and can warn each other of the presence of pests. In response, the plants will mount natural defenses against the infestation. This is an important part of sustainable agriculture."
1934,"A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just 1 kg (2 lb) to over 32 kg (70 lb) and are usually categorized by size or function. 1 Included among these breeds are the English Toy Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. 2  While small, they retain true terrier character and are not submissive  lap dogs 3  . Bull type Terriers: The Bull and Terrier types were originally combinations of bulldogs and terriers as general mixed breed bull-baiting and pit dogs."
1935,"Terriers are known for their sassy personalities and their penchant for picking fights with much larger dogs. Most of the breeds in this group are small, such as the Norfolk and Cairn, but there are also large terriers in the mix, such as the regal Airedale. They are smart dogs, and when they get bored, they can become a handful. Exercise helps keep their bodies and their minds active. Regular exercise also staves off obesity, a common problem in small terrier breeds."
1936,"Terrier Group is the name of a breed Group of dogs, used by kennel clubs to classify a defined collection of dog breeds. In general, a Terrier Group includes one particular type of dog, the Terrier, although other types may be included in a kennel club's Terrier Group. Most major English-language kennel clubs include a Terrier Group although different kennel clubs may not include the same breeds in their Terrier Group. When the classifications were changed, the dogs within the Jack Russell Terrier breed that were over 12 tall at the withers were moved into the Parson Russell Terrier breed. Any dog in the Jack Russell Terrier breed at this time (within the UKC) may not be over 12 tall."

Bull type Terriers: The Bull and Terrier types were originally combinations of bulldogs and terriers as general mixed breed bull-baiting and pit dogs."
1939,"Due to some unscrupulous breeders and unmindful owners, a few breeds within the terrier group have developed rather notorious reputations. The crossing of bulldogs and terriers for the express purpose of creating fighting dogs has produced several dog breeds that can be dangerous in the wrong hands. "
1940,"Terriers are not so good for people: Who lack confidence in controlling their dog, The terrier’s traits of fronting up larger challenges can mean they spar or scrap with other dogs, unless trained and socialised properly this can lead to some dangerous confrontations especially with the more powerful terrier dog breeds. 26 types of terrier are recognised by the AKC which makes the terrier group varied and versatile indeed.

1992,Alkalinity Alkalinity is a chemical measurement of a water’s ability to neutralize acids. Alkalinity is also a measure of a water’s buffering capacity or its ability to resist changes in pH upon the addition of acids or bases. Alkalinity of natural waters is due primarily to the presence of weak acid salts although strong bases may also contribute (i.e.

1994,"Water Contamination. The alkalinity of water is a measure of how much acid it can neutralize. If any changes are made to the water that could raise or lower the pH value, alkalinity acts as a buffer, protecting the water and its life forms from sudden shifts in pH."
1995,The reason alkalinity is sometime confused with pH is because the term alkaline is used to describe pH conditions greater than 7 (basic). The most important compounds in water that determine alkalinity include the carbonate (CO32-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions.
1996,Alkalinity is the name given to the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution to neutralize an acid. Measuring alkalinity is important in determining a stream's ability to neutralize acidic pollution from rainfall or wastewater. It is one of the best measures of the sensitivity of the stream to acid inputs.
1997,Introduction. Alkalinity is a measure of the capacity of water or any solution to neutralize or “buffer” acids. This measure of acid-neutralizing capacity is important in figuring out how “buffered” the water is against sudden changes in pH.

Best Answer: The reason coal, oil and natural gas are called fossil fuels is that they are formed from the fossilized remains of ancient plants & animals. With the right amount of heat and pressure (as well as a tremendous amount of time), these fossils will be converted into coal, oil, and natural gas. Source(s): "
2108,"Oil, petroleum, natural gas, gasoline, petrol, coal, coke: all these are types of what people call 'fossil fuels'. So why are they called 'fossil fuels'? Because, like fossils of shells or plants which you can find in some rocks, they are old, often hundreds of millions of years old. "
2109,"Where Fossil Fuels Come From. There are three major forms of fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. All three were formed many hundreds of millions of years ago before the time of the dinosaurs – hence the name fossil fuels. The age they were formed is called the Carboniferous Period. It was part of the Paleozoic Era. Fossil fuels take millions of years to make. We are using up the fuels that were made more than 300 million years ago before the time of the dinosaurs. Once they are gone they are gone."

2119,The name is Temperature Pressure Relief Valve (TPR valve). This safety valve releases water (and thus relieves pressure) if either the temperature or pressure in the tank gets too high. These valves are very important. The other reason for the TPR valve to run water is high pressure in the water heater tank. This is usually caused by one of two things -- high main water pressure (water district or well) or a back flow prevention/check valve.
2120,"1 Power operated valve-A pressure relief valve in which the main system to relieve pressure combined with and controlled by a device requires an external power source. 2  Is the standard safety valve-a valve opening to achieve the degree of buoyancy required for mass flow increases the pressure to reject over 10%. 1 Bellows valve-A direct-loaded safety relief valve and slide (or part) of rotating elements and sources are protected from the effects of fluid through bellows. 2  The bellows allows such an interpretation, it is as if the influences of pressure. 3  Controlled valve-A valve that consists of a main valve and a control unit."
2121,A pressure Relief Valve is a safety device designed to protect a pressurized vessel or system during an overpressure event. An overpressure event refers to any condition which would cause pressure in a vessel or system to increase beyond the specified design pressure or maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP). The primary purpose of a pressure Relief Valve is protection of life and property by venting fluid from an overpressurized vessel.
2122,"Pressure Relief Valve-is the term used to describe relief device on a liquid filled vessel. For such a valve the opening is proportional to increase in the vessel pressure. Hence the opening of valve is not sudden, but gradual if the pressure is increased gradually. Pressure Safety Valve-is the term used to describe relief device on a compressible fluid or gas filled vessel. For such a valve the opening is sudden. When the set pressure of the valve is reached, the valve opens almost fully. No related Pages. No related Pages"
2123,"In systems where the outlet is connected to piping, the opening of a relief valve will give a pressure build up in the piping system downstream of the relief valve. This often means that the relief valve will not re-seat once the set pressure is reached. For these systems often so called differential relief valves are used. This means that the pressure is only working on an area that is much smaller than the openings area of the valve."
2124,"A safety Relief Valve is a pressure Relief Valve characterized by rapid opening or pop action, or by opening in proportion to the increase in pressure over the opening pressure, depending on the application and may be used either for liquid or compressible fluid. An overpressure event refers to any condition which would cause pressure in a vessel or system to increase beyond the specified design pressure or maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP). The primary purpose of a pressure Relief Valve is protection of life and property by venting fluid from an overpressurized vessel."
2125,"The pressure relief valve is a type of valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system or vessel which can build up by a process upset, instrument or equipment failure, or fire. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurized fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. Pressure Relief Valves. Pressure Relief Valves protect against excessive pressure in pump stations, distribution systems, and transmission mains by opening when the inlet pressure exceeds a preset value and discharges high pressure water to waste pump suction or a zone of lower pressure."
2126,"Always use a relief valve with fixed-displacement hydraulic pumps. Pressure-compensated pump circuits also may use a relief valve for certain applications. Think of a relief valve in a hydraulic system as a fuse or circuit breaker in an electric circuit. An electric circuit never blows a fuse unless it overloads. When an electric circuit overloads, it is inoperable until reset. Examples of relief-valve circuits. Always locate the relief valve as close as possible to the outlet of a fixed-displacement pump. A pilot-operated relief works best because it does not pass any fluid until system pressure is very near the valve’s set pressure."

2129,"Stem cells are the body's raw materials — cells from which all other cells with specialized functions are generated. Under the right conditions in the body or a laboratory, stem cells divide to form more cells called daughter cells. These stem cells come from embryos that are three to five days old. At this stage, an embryo is called a blastocyst and has about 150 cells. These are pluripotent (ploo-RIP-uh-tunt) stem cells, meaning they can divide into more stem cells or can become any type of cell in the body."
2130,"A stem cell line is a group of cells that all descend from a single original stem cell and is grown in a lab. Cells in a stem cell line keep growing but don't differentiate into specialized cells. Ideally, they remain free of genetic defects and continue to create more stem cells. Clusters of cells can be taken from a stem cell line and frozen for storage or shared with other researchers. These stem cells are manipulated to specialize into specific types of cells, such as heart muscle cells, blood cells or nerve cells. The specialized cells can then be implanted into a person. For example, if the person has heart disease, the cells could be injected into the heart muscle."

2243,"The typical height of a bookshelf is fairly easy to determine if you base the height on two things: the number of shelves it will contain and what those shelves contain. Since books are about 3 inches shorter than magazines, a shelf that stores only books is shorter than a book shelf that stores only magazines. Maximum height for a set of built-in shelves is the height of the ceiling. That is 8 feet in standard homes, or 9 or more feet in luxury homes. Most built-in shelves in luxury homes have a top shelf installed a foot below the ceiling, and shelves spaced evenly along the wall."
2244,"The standard height for a two-shelf bookcase is 32 inches. The standard width is 31 inches. The depth will range from 12 to 13 inches. However, it’s not hard to find a two-shelf bookcase as tall as 36 inches. The range in height may vary from 41 inches to 48 inches. Standard widths for three-shelf bookcases range from 30 to 36 inches. The depth of a three-shelf bookcase will be between 12 and 13 inches."
2245,"1. For ease of shelf access, bookcases are generally no higher than 84 inches. Small bookcases are usually 30 to 42 inches high. The highest shelf in a bookcase should be as high as an average-sized person can comfortably reach – about 72 to 78 inches. If the shelves will be accessed from a sitting position, the highest shelf should be no more than 60 inches above the floor. The lowest shelf should be 3 to 4 inches from the floor level. 2."
2246,"Five-shelf bookcases range in height from 72 inches to 77 inches. The width will range from 31 inches to 37 inches, and the depth will be the standard of 12 to 13 inches. Taller five-shelf bookcases are often found in European stores, such as Ikea. The range in height may vary from 41 inches to 48 inches. Standard widths for three-shelf bookcases range from 30 to 36 inches. The depth of a three-shelf bookcase will be between 12 and 13 inches."

Books are average size and the shelves will be pretty full, not much display space"
2248,"On bookcases taller than 43 high, you can specify the height of the fixed shelf. The standard shelf height is 30, but 24 may be a better height for 4' and 5' bookcases. Specify the desired height from the bottom when ordering. The height will be the bookcase height minus 30 inches, since that is where the fixed shelf is located. Bookcases 12-18 wide will only have one door, those 24-42 wide will have two doors, and those 48-60 will have four doors. The doors on 6-8 foot bookcases will have double panels since they are very tall."
2249,"Bookshelf Shelf Spacing and Depth of Shelves. Each shelf in a bookshelf is set at a particular height depending on what type of book the shelving holds. For magazines, shelves are set 11 inches apart. For books, the shelves are spaced 10 inches apart. In addition to set shelving, many bookcases include one shelf for larger books and maps. Maximum height for a set of built-in shelves is the height of the ceiling. That is 8 feet in standard homes, or 9 or more feet in luxury homes. Most built-in shelves in luxury homes have a top shelf installed a foot below the ceiling, and shelves spaced evenly along the wall."

2254,Personally I start out with my smoker around 120-130 degrees and put my sausage in for an hour or so with no smoke to dry out a bit. Then I smoke at 130-150 (that's just how much my MES fluctuates) for about 2-4 hours(depending on the size of the sausage).
2255,I smoke longer because I like the smoke and it eventually soaks into the sausage. I smoke at low temperatures and keep slowly bumping up the temps 10-20 degrees at a time until the smoker reaches 175. Then I just wait until the sausage IT gets to 152-155. It can take 8-14 hours for a smoker full of summer sausage.

It belongs to a class of molecules called the nucleic acids, which are polynucleotides-that is, long chains of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three components: In eukaryotes, DNA molecules are tightly wound around proteins-called histone proteins-which provide structural support and play a role in controlling the activities of the genes. A strand 150 to 200 nucleotides long is wrapped twice around a core of eight histone proteins to form a structure called a nucleosome."
2307,"Polonium, also called Radium F, was the first element discovered by Marie S. Curie. She discovered it in 1898 while investigating radioactivity in pitchblende (uranium oxide). The element is named after Poland, the country of Curie's birth. Polonium is a rare, silvery-gray, radioactive low-melting metalloid. Polonium readily reacts with dilute acids, but only slightly with alkalis. All of its isotopes are radioactive. 210 Po emits a blue glow, as the air around it is excited by the decay products."
2308,"However, beta decay sources are more commonly used as they are less dangerous. 210 Po can be used as an atomic heat source but because of the isotope’s short half-life (138.4 days), it doesn’t provide power for long-term uses. Polonium is also used in anti-static brushes to eliminate dust on photographic film. It is sealed in brushes to control the radioactive emissions. Polonium was the first element Marie and Pierre Curie discovered. They discovered polonium and then radium in 1898, while working in Paris, investigating radioactivity in pitchblende (uranium oxide)."
2309,"Polonium is a chemical element with symbol Po and atomic number 84, discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie. A rare and highly radioactive element with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to bismuth and tellurium, and it occurs in uranium ores. Polonium is a radioactive element that exists in two metallic allotropes. The alpha form is the only known example of a simple cubic crystal structure in a single atom basis, with an edge length of 335.2 picometers; the beta form is rhombohedral."
2310,"When it is mixed or alloyed with beryllium, polonium can be a neutron source: beryllium releases a neutron upon absorption of an alpha particle that is supplied by 210 Po. It has been used in this capacity as a neutron trigger or initiator for nuclear weapons. Other uses include. "
2311,"Polonium is pronounced as peh-LOW-nee-em. History and Uses: Polonium was discovered by Marie Sklodowska Curie, a Polish chemist, in 1898. She obtained polonium from pitchblende, a material that contains uranium, after noticing that unrefined pitchblende was more radioactive than the uranium that was separated from it."
2312,"Appearance. A silvery-grey, radioactive semi-metal. Uses. Polonium is an alpha-emitter, and is used as an alpha-particle source in the form of a thin film on a stainless steel disc. These are used in antistatic devices and for research purposes. A single gram of polonium will reach a temperature of 500°C as a result of the alpha radiation emitted."
2313,"Polonium is a very rare radioactive element. Chemically, it is represented with the symbol Po. In the periodic table, it is placed in group 16 which is also known as chalcogen family. Other members of this family include Oxygen, Sulfur, Selenium, and Tellurium. It is the heaviest chemical element of this group. "
2314,"Polonium-210 is a radioactive isotope that occurs in small amounts in nature and can be made in a nuclear reactor. It has limited uses, mainly in static eliminators. In recent years, polonium made the news because of its use as a poison. Polonium-210 is used in manufacturing in devices that eliminate static. These devices are designed to meet tough NRC standards and pose no threat to public health or safety. The isotope is combined with silver or other metals in a foil mounted inside a protective cage."
2315,"All other polonium isotopes are short-lived except polonium-210 (half-life about 138 days), which is the most commonly used isotope. It is prepared by bombarding bismuth with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Polonium has 34 isotopes, more than any other element. All of these isotopes are radioactive. The most stable, polonium-209, has a half-life of about 103 years. Polonium-208 (half-life about 3 years) is the only other polonium isotope with a half-life over one year."

The picture below illustrates the six sided formation left from the living coral colonies found on the Petoskey stone."
2318,"What is a Petoskey Stone? The “Petoskey Stone,” which became the official state stone of Michigan in 1965, is actually a petrified fossil coral of the genus hexagonaria. Approximately 350 million years ago, a warm, salt water sea covered Michigan. In the depths of this sea, the members of the colony coral lived. This silt is seen as dark streaks on the Petoskey Stone.In a time before Native American Indians moved their teepees across the hills and dunes of Northern Michigan, before even the dinosaurs roamed the Earth, a warm, salt sea covered what is now Lake Michigan."
2319,"Much of what is known about the Devonian is interpreted from the fossil record. At least seven different species of the genus Hexagonaria are found in Devonian rocks in Michigan. The Petoskey Stone genera of corals are found in Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, New York, Canada, Germany, England, and even Asia. The Petoskey Stone -- Page 1 of 4 The Petoskey Stone Some history, lore and facts about the Petoskey Stone Wouldn't it be great if rocks could talk? For example, through legend and facts, a Petoskey Stone could tell you much about Michigan's history and geology."
2320,"THE PETOSKEY STONE What exactly is a Petoskey stone, and why is it called what it is? Actually, in this case, legend, geology, and history are intertwined to give the definition of what the Petoskey stone actually is. The study of the geology of the Petoskey stone also gives one quite an idea of how life was in Michigan during the Devonian time."
2321,"It was formed by the fossilization of ancient coral, Hexagonaria. The coral lived in shallow waters and today’s fossil often includes ancient silt and mud. Petoskey Stones are often found on many beaches of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, as well as in rock quarries from Traverse City to Alpena. The honeycomb patterned stone has a hardness from 4 to 5 and is the official state stone of Michigan. This fossil is around 350 million years old. Fordite. "
2322,"So, what is a Petoskey stone? It is a fossil colonial coral that lived in the warm Michigan seas during the Devonian time around 350 million years ago. The name Hexagonaria (meaning six sides) percarinata was designated by Dr. Edwin Stumm in 1969 because of his extensive knowledge of fossils. Actually, in this case, legend, geology, and history are intertwined to give the definition of what the Petoskey stone actually is. The study of the geology of the Petoskey stone also gives one quite an idea of how life was in Michigan during the Devonian time."
2323,"A Petoskey stone is a rock and a fossil, often pebble-shaped, that is composed of a fossilized rugose coral, Hexagonaria percarinata. The stones were formed as a result of glaciation, in which sheets of ice plucked stones from the bedrock, grinding off their rough edges and depositing them in the northwestern (and some in the northeastern) portion of Michigan 's lower peninsula."
2324,"The city of Petoskey, Michigan, is also named after him, and is the center of the area where the stones are found. The stones are commonly found on beaches and in sand dunes. According to legend, Petosegay was a descendant of French nobleman and fur trader, Antoine Carre and an Ottawa princess. The stones were formed as a result of glaciation, in which sheets of ice plucked stones from the bedrock, grinding off their rough edges and depositing them in the northwestern (and some in the northeastern) portion of Michigan 's lower peninsula."

But in recent years, more researchers argue that it’s not the most accurate way to measure body weight."
2351,"Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of weight adjusted for height, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m 2). Although BMI is often considered an indicator of body fatness, it is a surrogate measure of body fat because it measures excess weight rather than excess fat."

2373,A titer is a laboratory test that measures the presence and amount of antibodies in blood. A titer may be used to prove immunity to disease. A blood sample is taken and tested. If the test is positive (above a particular known value) the individual has immunity. If the test is negative (no immunity) or equivocal (not enough immunity) you need to be vaccinated. A Titer Lab Report is generated by the lab that tested the blood sample.
2374,A titre is a method used to find the concentration of a given solution by Titration. It is used in the filed of Chemistry as an analyticla tool for finding the concentrations. It is also used in blood tests. A titre in a blood test measures the concentration of antibody in the blood of a human. This test is normally performed to find out if an individual has developed immunity to any particular diseases by detecting the essential concentration of antibodies in his/her body. 
2375,The antibody titer is a test that detects the presence and measures the amount of antibodies within a person’s blood. The amount and diversity of antibodies correlates to the strength of the body’s immune response. The binding of antigens to antibodies sparks the immune response. This is a complex interaction of immune tissues and cells that work to defend against invading organisms and fight infection. A second part of the immune response against infection is the presence of memory cells.
2376,"An antibody titer is a measurement of how much antibody an organism has produced that recognizes a particular epitope, expressed as the inverse of the greatest dilution that still gives a positive result. ELISA is a common means of determining antibody titers. If a few weeks later the same patient had an indirect Coombs titer of 32 (1/32 dilution which is 1 part serum to 31 parts diluent), this would mean that she was making more anti-Rh antibody, since it took a greater dilution to abolish the positive test. There are two main kinds of titer testing that one can do."
2377,Antibody titer is a laboratory test that measures the level of antibodies in a blood sample. The antibody level in the blood tells your doctor whether or not you have been exposed to an antigen or something that the body thinks is foreign. The body uses antibodies to attack and remove foreign substances. The antibody titer is also used to determine: 1  The strength of an immune response to the body's own tissue in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune disorders. 2  If you need a booster immunization. 3  Whether a previous vaccine helped your immune system protect you against the specific disease.
2378,The indirect Coombs test finds certain antibodies that are in the liquid part of your blood (serum). These antibodies can attack red blood cells but are not attached to your red blood cells. The indirect Coombs test is commonly done to find antibodies in a recipient's or donor's blood before a transfusion.

2421,"From standard ceilings to vaulted, popcorn, coffered, or beam, there are plenty of options for ceiling types. The cost to install a ceiling will depend on what type of ceiling you want. Standard, smooth drywall ceilings will have the lowest installation costs. Vaulted ceilings use more materials and are taller, which can bring ceiling installation costs up. Generally, the larger the home or room, the more the cost to install a ceiling will end up being. However, with drywall projects, the inverse is actually true. It costs more per square foot for smaller drywall jobs, like repairs, than larger ones like installation."
2422,"If your project list includes a ceiling treatment, you may be wondering whether to install a drop ceiling or a drywall ceiling. There are a number of good reasons DIYers prefer drop ceilings vs. drywall. Let’s look at a few. Installing Drywall Requires More Labor. From start to finish, more physical work goes into a drywall ceiling vs. a drop ceiling. Drywall sheets average about 60 lbs. and hoisting them up to the ceiling requires two sets of sturdy arms or a drywall lift."
2423,"Basement Ceiling and Dropped Ceiling Tile Disadvantages. When deciding between dropped ceiling tiles vs drywall ceilings for your basement ceiling, it is important that you consider the height of your unfinished basement. The one key downside of installing dropped ceiling tiles is that your basement ceiling will be lower, compared to installing a drywall ceiling. You will need 3-4 inches of space between your main floor floor-joists and your dropped ceiling tiles. "
2424,"Andrew says. Jason, Take a look a Ceiling Link, it’s a PVC based “drop ceiling” system that only costs you about 1″ of space, only twice the space of drywall. A 1000 SQ Ft basement (assuming 20X50) would run you $707 in ceiling link parts, $40 in screws and $700 to 900 in panels (2′ X 4′). Drywall for the basement ceiling, .5 inch. Carpet and padding maybe .75 of an inch. Otherwise there are no framing elements on the ceiling or the floor. Unless you want install a framed sub-floor, but that’s not the normal case for most finished basements."

2426,"Drywall, also commonly referred to as sheetrock or wall board, is a lightweight cost efficient product for use on interior walls or ceiling panels in new construction, renovation and repair work. In residential construction the most commonly used sizes are 4 x 8 foot x ½ inch. "
2427,"The cost to install drywall is about $1.50 per square foot. After material and labor are added in, the cost per panel can range from around $40.00 to $60.00. A typical 12x12 room, for example, will use 12 panels. "
2428,"The ceiling tiles can be moved in and out to allow access to any part of your ceiling should you ever need it. If you select a reasonably priced ceiling tile, the cost of the acoustic ceiling will be about the same as a drywall ceiling, with all factors considered (hanging, finishing, painting, etc.). That being said, there is one benefit to an acoustical ceiling that you do not get with drywall: choices. "

2432,"Coordinated Colors. Since gold is a natural metal, it's a good idea to pair it with other earth tones and metallics. Silver, brown, taupe, nude, maroon and copper go well with various gold shades. Try wearing refreshing white in the summer and chic, edgy black when the weather turns cool. Keep in mind that hues such as navy, ruby and emerald on belts, shoes, jewelry and purses accentuate the gold instead of competing with it."
2433,"If purple is used as a complementary color, go to either side of it, and you'll find the split complementary colors--blue and blue-purple. Blue is bold, as is gold.

To defend that freedom as an individual, you will of course need a gun. This is the America that conservatives really want. No one can be free without these, and without a commitment to care and act on that care by one's fellow citizens. The conservative worldview rejects all of that. Conservatives believe in individual responsibility alone, not social responsibility. They don't think government should help its citizens."

2633,"Best Answer: To write a letter you need a word-processing application. When you buy a new pc with whatever version of Windows you usually get Microsoft Works thrown in. That is a cut-down version of Microsoft Office, and it has a word processor (its quite a basic word processor actually and one th at is awkward to use). Report Abuse. It is an easy matter provided you have the software. If you do not have Microsoft Office, and here you would use Word to write your letter, you will have both NotePad and WordPad, that is assuming you have a Microsoft Operating System, i.e. XP or Vista. They are both basic text processing programs but you could do a straightforward letter in them"

2647,"Intel Socket 2011: The Consumer-CPU Pinnacle. Socket 2011 is Intel’s maximum-performance platform, and home to the fastest consumer, non-server processor you can buy today from a raw benchmarking point of view: the Intel Core i7-4960X Extreme Edition. This socket debuted with the Sandy Bridge-E (for “Extreme”) line of processors in late 2011. "
2648,"Your CPU speed, also known as the speed of your computer processor, determines how fast everything happens on your computer. If your CPU speed is slow, there isn’t much you can do about it (although we will discuss some options later). Finding your CPU speed on Windows is easy: 1  Go to the start menu. 2  Right-click the My Computer link for Windows XP or “Computer” for Vista and Windows Seven. 3  Choose Properties from the context menu that appears."
2649,"Processor (CPU). The overall speed or clock speed of the computer and how fast it is capable of processing data is managed by the computer processor (CPU). The computer will be much faster and more powerful when it is capable of executing more instructions every second. For example, the first computer processor was the Intel 4004, which was only a 740 kHz processor and capable of processing approximately 92,000 instructions per second."
2650,"BUS speed. The bus speed of the motherboard can increase or decrease the speed at which data is being transferred between all the hardware components in the computer. For example, a Front Side Bus (FSB) of 66 MHz is going to be much slower than a 400 MHz FSB. The computer will be much faster and more powerful when it is capable of executing more instructions every second. For example, the first computer processor was the Intel 4004, which was only a 740 kHz processor and capable of processing approximately 92,000 instructions per second."
2651,"On one level, choosing a processor speed for your business' computers is simple. The faster your processor speed, the faster your computer will move, and, all things being equal, the more it will cost. Every time that the clock ticks, the processor can execute an instruction or read and write data. A 3.0 GHz processor has 3 billion opportunities per second to do something, while a 3.6 GHz processor has 3.6 billion chances -- making it roughly 20 percent faster."
2652,"When you purchase a computer the processor speed is the most important thing to look for. Many people will say that RAM or hard drive stats are more important, but a computer can have 5GB of RAM but a slow processor and you still won’t get a lot done. Think of the processor speed as the brain speed of your PC. You need a balanced and well rounded PC for the processor speed to actually make a significant difference. If you have a 3.2 Ghz processor speed but weak statistics on everything else, then it isn’t worth all of the money spent. Having a system with good balance is ideal."
2653,"Why You Can’t Just Compare Clock Speeds. CPU clock speed, or clock rate, is measured in Hertz — generally in gigahertz, or GHz. A CPU’s clock speed rate is a measure of how many clock cycles a CPU can perform per second. For example, a CPU with a clock rate of 1.8 GHz can perform 1,800,000,000 clock cycles per second. This seems simple on its face. "
2654,"The speed of a computer's processor is measured in megahertz, or cycles per second. But higher megahertz doesn't always mean better performance. Though a 600-MHz chip has a clock speed that is twice as fast as a 300-Mhz chip, it doesn't mean that the computer with the 600-Mhz chip will run twice as fast. "
2655,"In the old days, choosing a computer was easy: you bought the one with the fastest processor you could afford. And you knew which processor was fastest (more or less) by its numerical clock-speed rating. These days it's a lot trickier. Only hard-core techies (and those with the patience to search in Google) know the difference between, say, an AMD A4-3305M and an Intel Core i3-2350M. "
2656,"The CPU. “CPU” stands for Central Processing Unit, and is also known as a “processor”. The CPU speed, or processor speed, is the amount of cycles that a CPU can perform per second. This is otherwise known as a Hertz. For example, one Hertz means that one cycle can be completed in one second. "

It uses ASP features such as b-frames, global and quarter pixel motion compensation, lumi masking, trellis quantization, and H.263, MPEG and custom quantization matrices."
2662,"XviD is a very popular codec and as such, there are many thousands of files available that contain XviD video. It is fairly unlikely that you will have a file with the extension.xvid. In all likelihood, your file is named something along the lines of Filename.XviD.AVI ."
2663,When you install the XviD codec it basically provides your system with specific instructions how to compress and decompress video in the XviD format. Once you've installed the XviD codec on your system you will be able to play XviD videos using Windows Media Player or any other XviD-enabled player.
2664,The Xvid codec compresses video files to make them smaller. It can compress video at a ratio of 200:1 or more compared to uncompressed video. This makes transmitting the video over a network speedy or saves you a lot of space on your computer's hard disk.

The fan motor for your AC unit is an integral part of the air conditioning system. Without the fan motor, the fan would not spin. This means that the cold air produced by the air conditioning unit would not be propelled out of the unit and into the home or building."
2865,Parts: $162 - $275. The average cost for a radiator fan motor replacement is between $273 to $416. Labor costs are estimated between $111 to $141 while parts are priced between $162 to $275.

2866,"Air Conditioner Fan Motor Replacement Cost. It appears that the motor that spins the fan in the air conditioner died last night. I cannot spin the fan blades and the motor makes a loud buzzing sound when turned on and the blades do not move at all and the motor is very hot and smells like it burnt out. I am 95% sure that this is the only problem with the unit. Well, I had the unit looked at and the fan motor is bad and needs to be replaced, but the guy said he thinks that the motor is going to cost about $500 before labor. He is going to look up the price when he gets back to the shop but I cannot believe that it costs that much."
2867,"The problem with that is you can be penny wise and pound foolish. A bad fan motor could end up shortening the life of your AC Compressor. Replacing an fan motor may run between $400 - $500. But it sure beats replacing an AC Compressor which runs in a range of $1000-$2000. Obviously, it takes a well trained technician to be able to correctly diagnose the problem, know how to install it, and can test the new part or system to make sure it works properly. "
2868,"1 However, if you want to do the job yourself, the costs for the fan motor itself will usually be between $50 and $200. 2  For example, users on DSLReports.com said that a DIY job will cost around $75. 3  If the professionals are brought in, plan on spending around $300 to $500. The fan motor for your AC unit is an integral part of the air conditioning system. Without the fan motor, the fan would not spin. This means that the cold air produced by the air conditioning unit would not be propelled out of the unit and into the home or building."
2869,Replacing the motor without the same specs can cause higher utility cost and a shorter life span of the air conditioning system. Also replace the run capacitor when you replace the condenser fan motor. The average cost to replace the condenser fan more can range from $350 to $575. 2) The Condenser fan relay is bad. New condensers have a relay they turn the motor on and off when the system starts and turns off. The cost to replace a condenser fan relay can range from $175 to $275 the cost depends more on the make and model of the unit and the contractor installing the part.
2870,"1 Replacing the fan motor for your AC unit professionally for an existing air conditioning unit can cost anywhere from $300 to $600 depending on the model of the fan motor. 2  This will include checking the kind of unit, the voltage, the phase and the running load current to make sure that the fan motor does not fail. The fan motor for your AC unit is an integral part of the air conditioning system. Without the fan motor, the fan would not spin. This means that the cold air produced by the air conditioning unit would not be propelled out of the unit and into the home or building."
2871,The run capacitor gives the motor a jump start every time it starts. The cost to replace a run capacitor for a condenser fan motor from an HVAC contractor can range from $150 to $275 depending on the size and the labor need to install the part. 2) The Condenser fan relay is bad. New condensers have a relay they turn the motor on and off when the system starts and turns off.

2885,There is no formula for amplitude as such. It is calculated directly from the graph of the wave. That is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position is the amplitude. If we consider the sine wave then we have a formula which related the peak to peak amplitude to the rms amplitude of the sine wave. Semi amplitude = +V or-V. Root Mean Square Amplitude: It is also called RMS is the root of the mean of the squared value of the maximum distance from the baseline of the wav
2886,"Amplitude is the magnitude of change in the oscillating variable with each oscillation within an oscillating system. For example, sound waves in air are oscillations in atmosp … heric pressure and their amplitudes are proportional to the change in pressure during one oscillation. The amplitude of a sound wave is the measure of the intensity of the sound, such as loudness."
2887,F is the frequency of the wave. The amplitude of a variable is a measure of its change over a single period. The maximum height observed in the wave is called as Amplitude. It is denoted by A and is given in decibels (dB) . The sine wave is represented as. Where A is amplitude and $\omega$ is angular frequency. The Amplitude Formula is given by. Where D is the distance traveled by the wave and. Amplitude Formula is used to the amplitude of the given wave if its distance and frequency are known. 
2888,"The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. Peak-to-peak amplitude is the change between peak (highest amplitude value) and trough (lowest amplitude value, which can be negative). With appropriate circuitry, peak-to-peak amplitudes of electric oscillations can be measured by meters or by viewing the waveform on an oscilloscope"
2889,"Part (a): The wave's amplitude, wavelength, and frequency can be determined from the equation of the wave: y(x,t) = (0.9 cm) sin[(1.2 m -1)x - (5.0 s -1)t]. The amplitude is whatever is multiplying the sine. A = 0.9 cm. The wavenumber k is whatever is multiplying the x: Let's say that for a particular wave on a string the equation is: y(x,t) = (0.9 cm) sin[(1.2 m -1)x - (5.0 s -1)t]. (a) Determine the wave's amplitude, wavelength, and frequency. (b) Determine the speed of the wave. (c) If the string has a mass/unit length of m = 0.012 kg/m, determine the tension in the string."
2890,"The quantities that are used for waves include Frequency, amplitude, wavelength, and wave speed. The amplitude of wave is determined by measuring the graphical representation of wave.

If we consider the sine wave then we have a formula which related the peak to peak amplitude to the rms amplitude of the sine wave."
2891,"In amplitude modulation, the amplitude or strength of the carrier oscillations is what is varied. For example, in AM radio communication, a continuous wave radio-frequency signal (a sinusoidal carrier wave) has its amplitude modulated by an audio waveform before transmission. Amplitude modulation (AM) is a modulation technique used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave. In amplitude modulation, the amplitude (signal strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the waveform being transmitted."
2892,"The 12-month prevalence rate of this disorder is between 0.2 and 3.3 percent. Like most personality disorders, antisocial personality disorder typically will decrease in intensity with age, with many people experiencing few of the most extreme symptoms by the time they are in the 40s or 50s."
2893,Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others.

2923,"When it comes to the concept of ‘business function’ it is tempting to simply transplant the concept of ‘application function’ to the business domain, and use it to represent a type of ‘organisational functionality’ (i.e., a set of instructions carried out by personnel to change the state of an object). If it is the former than it is a part of the business architecture, if the later then it is not. The business function is: what a business unit (part of organization) should do (tasks/stages in the value stream) in order to realize a capability."

2928,"Administration. The administration function of a business is a macro function that oversees all other functions. The administrative staff usually includes the CEO or president, COO -- chief operating officer -- and secretarial staff. This is the function through which corporate policies are made and communicated. "
2929,"Recently I was asked about the concepts of a Business Function and a Capability, and how it is unfortunate that these concepts tend to be blended together. The term “function” is used to describe a unit of business capability at all levels of granularity, encapsulating terms such as value chain, process area, capability, business function, etc. Any bounded unit of business function should be described as a function."

2933,"1. A PhD takes twice as long as a bachelor's degree to complete. The average student takes 8.2 years to slog through a PhD program and is 33 years old before earning that top diploma. By that age, most Americans with mere bachelor's degree are well into establishing themselves professionally. 2. Professors will exploit you. About 40 percent of PhD candidates borrow money to obtain their degrees, with the average debt nearly $37,000, according to FinAid.org. This debt would be on top of any loans a student assumed as an undergraduate. 7. You probably won't get tenure."
2934,"Report Abuse. I read in one of the graduate admission guide published by Princeton Review that the average age of PhD students at the time of their start is around 27, depending on the discipline. So the average age at time of graduation is about mid-thirties. "
2935,"The average graduate student today is 33 years old. Students in doctoral programs are a bit older. However, the average graduate student in the late 1990’s was just under 33 years. In fact, according to the Council of Graduate Schools, the age of graduate students has remained static over the last few decades. Most students take longer than that to earn undergraduate degrees. In fact, according to Forbes, only 58 percent of students graduate with a bachelor’s degree within six years. Many don’t graduate at all. After all that time, and all that debt, many people just want to get out of the education system for a while."
2936,"Average age to start a PhD varies between disciplines and depends on whether or not the student holds a masters degree or not. I was made to believe that the vast majority start a PhD between the ages of 22-28 in most fields. Time to complete can vary widely. A masters degree is typically limited to 1-5 years, with most taking 2-3. A PhD following a masters is typically limited to 3-8 years, while a direct to PhD requires 4-8. He was 20 years old when he graduated. Noam Elkies finished his PhD in math at Harvard in 2 years, at age 20. 6 years later, he became the youngest tenured professor in the history of Harvard, beating even Larry Summers and Alan Dershowitz."
2937,"Getting a doctorate is intellectually rewarding. Unfortunately, it doesn't tend to be financially rewarding, at least not in the short term. Most PhD students live on their earnings from teaching and research assistantships or other low-paying employment. So, your starving student days may not be behind you. "
2938,"Those who work a full time job and sometimes an extra part time job can take up to 6-8 years to complete their bachelor's because of their limited time and limited cashflow. So if one who started at age 18, the average age of these people is around 24-26. 25% of Americans have a Bachelor's degree. But because many can now acquire the BA more conveniently, the average age is harder to determine. An educated guess would be around 33. Most students take 4 years to complete them although it is not uncommon to finish in as little as 3 years or as many as 5. The abov … e is a general answer, but statistics from the College Board tell us that the average time to earn a bachelor's degree is 4.7 years (2008)."
2939,"In my case, I was 28 when I started my PhD and 33 when I finished. There were a handful of people older than me in the class, in their mid-thirties. Probably the median was about 25. Even though I wasn’t that much older, my (tenured) advisor was two weeks younger than me. "
2940,"It depends on the field-in one of my fields it's common to have a master's and work experience before coming to get a Ph.D, whereas in the other it's more common to come from undergrad or after maybe 1-3 years working as a lab assistant (and so the students in that program are closer to my age).

The satellites are located in middle circular orbit at 19,100 kilometres (11,900 mi) altitude with a 64.8 degree inclination and a period of 11 hours and 15 minutes."
2942,"Some advice from my friends, the previous iPad mini comes with (Assisted GPS and GLONASS) which has good connection when using flying/aviation applicatons, where as the new iPad mini only Assisted GPS. So i need futher explaination. It stands for Assiseted GPS. The iPads with cellular have a GPS. They use WiFi and cellular to assist the GPS in locking on more quickly. The GPS is assisted by the WiFi and cellular. It will work just fine while flying. WiFi ony iPads rely on WiFi for location services."
2943,"A-GPS stands for Assisted Global Positioning System. While it works on the same principles as a GPS (explained below), the difference here is that it gets the information from the satellites by using network resources e.g. mobile network, also called assistant servers. A-GPS and GPS are different navigational aids that both use information from satellites to determine their exact location on Earth. GPS stands for Global Positioning System. A GPS device communicates with 4 or more satellites to determine its exact location coordinates (latitude and longitude) anywhere on Earth."
2944,"On 2 October 2011 the 24th satellite of the system, a GLONASS-M, was successfully launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome and is now in service. This made the GLONASS constellation fully restored, for the first time since 1996. GLONASS is a global satellite navigation system, providing real time position and velocity determination for military and civilian users. The satellites are located in middle circular orbit at 19,100 kilometres (11,900 mi) altitude with a 64.8 degree inclination and a period of 11 hours and 15 minutes."
2945,"Manufacturers of GPS devices say that adding GLONASS made more satellites available to them, meaning positions can be fixed more quickly and accurately, especially in built-up areas where the view to some GPS satellites is obscured by buildings.

The satellites are located in middle circular orbit at 19,100 kilometres (11,900 mi) altitude with a 64.8 degree inclination and a period of 11 hours and 15 minutes."
2946,"A-GPS is extensively used with GPS-capable cellular phones, as its development was accelerated by the U.S. FCC 's 911 requirement to make cell phone location data available to emergency call dispatchers. 1 It can supply orbital data or almanac for the GPS satellites to the GPS receiver, enabling the GPS receiver to lock to the satellites more rapidly in some cases. 2  The network can provide precise time. 3  Mobile Station Assisted (MSA): Calculation of position by the server using information from the GPS receiver."
2947,"Assisted GLONASS Data. Assisted GLONASS (A-GLONASS) data are now available to GDGPS customers, to enhance the performance of GLONASS chipsets. The GLONASS navigation message, the GLONASS broadcast ephemeris and the GLONASS Almanac are redundantly provided from all three GDGPS Operations Centers (GOCs). The GLONASS navigation message, bit-by-bit, is provided as a real-time UDP binary data stream."
2948,"GPS and GLONASS: similarities and differences. GPS-this is the first letters of the English words Global Positioning System, which translated into Russian means global positioning system.. Sometimes there is an inaccurate understanding of the word global. GPS-is an American global positioning system, consisting of 24 satellites, a network of ground tracking stations for them, and an unlimited number of user receivers, calculators. GPS is used to determine the user's current position on the Earth's surface or in near space."

Most Maple species are deciduous, however a few species in southern Asia and the Mediterranean region are evergreen."
2968,"The red maple, swamp maple or soft maple, is a common species in eastern Canada. This maple is highly variable and goes by several different names. It also hybridizes with the silver maple causing several intermediate varieties to occur. Young trees provide browse for deer. There are ten species (some have as many as three different names) of maple tree native to Canada. They grow in all areas of the country except the territories. The sugar maple, an eastern species, may be called hard or rock maple, and is the principal source of maple syrup and sugar."

3006,"A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it. The Valley of Marvels in Babille, Ethiopia. In geology, a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide. The terms U-shaped and V-shaped are descriptive terms of geography to characterize the form of valleys. A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice."
3007,"Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the Earth and they are formed through erosion or the gradual wearing down of the land by wind and water. In river valleys for example, the river acts as an erosional agent by grinding down the rock or soil and creating a valley. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo)."
3008,"A valley formed by flowing water, or river valley, is usually V-shaped. The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in mountain ranges, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice."
3009,"A glacier is a large body of ice that formed on land by the compaction and recrystallization of snow, survives year to year, and shows some sign of movement downhill due to gravity. The three main types of valleys are the V-shaped valley, the flat-floored valley, and the U-shaped valley. A V-shaped valley is a narrow valley that has a profile suggesting the form of the letter V, characterized by steeply sloping sides. It results from a stream eroding downward, a process referred to as downcutting."
3010,"U shaped Valley-Yosemite. As a glacier moves downhill through a valley, the shape of the valley is transformed. A V-shaped valley is transformed into a U-shaped valley through the glacial erosion processes of plucking and abrasion. This results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier. A material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley. U-shaped valley in Leh valley, Ladakh, NW Indian Himalaya. The glacier visible at the head of the valley is the last remnants of the formerly much more extensive valley glacier which carved this valley."
3011,"This is because they flowed down pre-existing river or V-shaped valleys during the last glaciation and caused the bottom of the V to level out into a U shape as the ice eroded the valley walls, resulting in a wider, deeper valley. For this reason, U-shaped valleys are sometimes referred to as glacial troughs. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo)."
3012,"A valley is a hollow or surface depression of the earth bounded by hills or mountains, a natural trough in the earth's surface, that slopes down to a stream, lake or the ocean, formed by water and/or ice erosion. Systems of valleys extend through plains, hills, and mountains. "

They are carved by flowing water or flowing ice through the process of erosion, which is the gradual wearing away of Earth surfaces through the action of wind and water. A V-shaped valley is a narrow valley that has a profile suggesting the form of the letter V, characterized by steeply sloping sides. It results from a stream eroding downward, a process referred to as downcutting."
3014,"Landforms of the upper valley-V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Landforms in upland regions are dominantly created by erosion processes, where land is worn away. Generally, the volume and discharge of rivers in upland regions tends to be low, and the river uses much of it's energy in overcoming friction. "
3015,Natural polymers. Polymers are very common in nature; some of the most widespread naturally occurring substances are polymers. Starch and cellulose are examples. Green plants have the ability to take the simple sugar known as glucose and make very long chains containing many glucose units. 
3016,"Examples of naturally occurring condensation polymers are cellulose, the polypeptide chains of proteins, and poly(β-hydroxybutyric acid), a polyester synthesized in large quantity by certain soil and water bacteria. Formulas for these will be displayed below by clicking on the diagram. "
3017,"Most natural polymers are condensation polymers, and in their formation from monomers water is a by-product. Starch is a condensation polymer made up of hundreds of glucose monomers, which split out water molecules as they chemically combine. Usually natural polymers are composed by condensation polymerisation with the elimination of water molecule. Starch is another example of such type of polymer which is formed by the condensation polymerisation of a large number of glucose molecules."
3018,"Best Answer: Naturally occurring polymers include rubber and amber. A polymer molecule has a high molecular mass and is comprised of many smaller, repeating subunits or monomers. Polymers may be found in nature, such as the DNA and proteins found in living cells, or created in laboratories or factories. Polymer molecules come in many shapes and sizes."
3019,"POLYMERS. Polymers are substances whose molecules have high molar masses and are composed of a large number of repeating units. There are both naturally occurring and synthetic polymers. Among naturally occurring polymers are proteins, starches, cellulose, and latex. Synthetic polymers are produced commercially on a very large scale and have a wide range of properties and uses. The materials commonly called plastics are all synthetic polymers. Polymers are formed by chemical reactions in which a large number of molecules called monomers are joined sequentially, forming a chain. In many polymers, only one monomer is used. In others, two or three different monomers may be combined"
3020,"Natural vs Synthetic Polymers. There are two types of polymers: synthetic and natural. Synthetic polymers are derived from petroleum oil, and made by scientists and engineers. Examples of synthetic polymers include nylon, polyethylene, polyester, Teflon, and epoxy. Natural polymers occur in nature and can be extracted. They are often water-based. Examples of naturally occurring polymers are silk, wool, DNA, cellulose and proteins. "
3021,"Naturally occurring polymers such as cotton, starch and rubber were familiar materials for years before synthetic polymers such as polyethene and perspex appeared on the market. Many commercially important polymers are synthesized by chemical modification of naturally occurring polymers. A polymer (/ˈpɒlɨmər/) (Greek poly- , many + -mer, parts) is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits."
3022,"Linked chains are also important in chemistry. These kinds of chains are called polymers. The word comes from the Greek, polu meaning 'many' and meros meaning 'share.' A polymer is a chain of repeated units, called monomers. "
3023,"Polymers are widely found in nature. The human body contains many natural polymers, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Cellulose, another natural polymer, is the main structural component of plants. Most natural polymers are condensation polymers, and in their formation from monomers water is a by-product. It is also referred to as a polysaccharide, because it is a polymer of the monosaccharide glucose. Starch molecules include two types of glucose polymers, amylose and amylopectin, the latter being the major starch component in most plants, making up about three-fourths of the total starch in wheat flour."

3025,"Sweat glands, also known as sudoriferous glands, are small tubular structures of skin that produce sweat. They are distributed all over the skin, except lips, glans penis and nail bed. These glands are of two types: Eccrine and Apocrine. Eccrine glands are much more abundant and distributed in almost every part of the skin. Each one of these is a single tube, the deep part of which is coiled into a ball. The coiled part is called body of the gland. It lies in the deeper part of corium or in the subcutaneous tissue. The straight part is called duct."
3026,"Generally, sweat glands consist of a secretory unit consisting of a base rolled into a glomerulum, and a duct that carries the sweat away. The secretory coil or base, is set deep in the lower dermis and hypodermis, and the entire gland is surrounded by adipose tissue. 1 Eccrine sweat glands are distributed almost all over the human body, in varying densities. 2  Its water-based secretion represents a primary form of cooling in humans."
3027,"Fat (adipose) tissue also produces hormones that regulate metabolism and appetite. Additionally, the term gland does not mean that the organ is part of the endocrine system. For example, sweat glands, glands in mucus membranes, and mammary glands secrete substances other than hormones. Major Endocrine Glands. Not all organs that secrete hormones or hormonelike substances are considered part of the endocrine system. For example, the kidneys produce the hormone renin to help control blood pressure and the hormone erythropoietin to stimulate the bone marrow to produce red blood cells."
3028,"Sweat glands in the skin secrete a fluid waste called sweat or perspiration; however, its primary functions are temperature control and pheromone release. Therefore, its role as a part of the excretory system is minimal. Sweating also maintains the level of salt in the body. Only the organs specifically used for the excretion are considered a part of the excretory system. In the narrow sense, the term refer to the urinary system. However, at excretion involves several functions that are only superficially related, it is not usually used in more formal classifications of anatomy or function."
3029,"Sweat and Oil Glands. Sweat Glands. Sweat Glands are made up of two sub-glands; eccrine and apocrine. Eccrine sweat glands are coiled tubes that orriginate from the dermis layer. They are more numerous than the apocrine sweat glands, and are all over the human body. Mainly, the eccrine glands are on the forehead, the upper lip, palms of hands and soles of feet. Eccrine sweat glands produce sweat/perspiration, and a section that is 99% water"

3091,"Fatwood, also known as fat lighter, lighter wood, rich lighter, pine knot, lighter knot, heart pine or lighter'd [ sic ], is derived from the heartwood of pine trees. This resin-impregnated heartwood becomes hard and rot-resistant. In Louisiana fatwood is known as rich lighter and cut slivers are what is referred to as kindling because of the abundance. The pitch-soaked wood produces an oily, sooty smoke, and it is recommended that one should not cook on a fire until all the fatwood has completely burned out."
3092,"Simply nature’s best fire starter. Born from the wood of old pine stumps left for waste after logging, it is made from splitting the stumps of pine trees that contain a high concentration of natural resin. As the stumpwood hardens over time, the resin or sap concentrates to create an all-natural, 100% organic, chemical-free fire starter. The stumps are split into sticks approximately 8″ in length and 3/4″ in diameter. We’ve found this size to be a convenient and ideal size for practically all applications. Whether using it in the fireplace, the backyard BBQ, a pellet stove, or even in the woods while camping, Fatwood Firestarter is the ideal choice."
3093,"Fatwood is scar tissue of a damaged or injured pine tree. A lightning strike will scar a tree sometimes top to bottom without necessarily killing the tree. The result scar of burnt bark will scar over with resin. Once hardened, the wood and bark around the area becomes rich with the flammable hardened resin. In Louisiana fatwood is known as rich lighter and cut slivers are what is referred to as kindling because of the abundance.

Whether using it in the fireplace, the backyard BBQ, a pellet stove, or even in the woods while camping, Fatwood Firestarter is the ideal choice."
3096,"No, fatwood isn’t just wood that could stand to go on a diet. Also known as pitchwood, lighter pine, and dozens of other nicknames, fatwood is an easy igniting substance that comes from the heartwood of pine trees. When a pine tree is cut down, struck by lightning, broken by force, or even just loses a limb, the tree’s roots continue to send pitch — or resin, the sticky substance that hardens into amber — to the wounded area."
3097,"You’ve probably heard of fatwood, the miracle fire starter. “Miracle” might be a bit strong, but fatwood makes wonderful tinder and kindling. Finding and harvesting fatwood is easy. Here’s how. To get the sticks, it works great to baton through the fatwood planks with a smaller knife, as described above. When you’re heading for the hills, just throw a stick of fatwood in your pack. A single stick of fatwood will produce enough shavings and small kindling to start quite a few fires."
3098,"You may know it by another name – fatwood, lighter wood, fat lighter, pine knot, or some other alias. Fat lighter’d, as Uncle Otha called it, is a 100% nature-made fire starter. The resin in conifers concentrates in the base of the tree. "

3108,"Plants use sunlight for photosynthesis. Plants use sunlight for photosynthesis. The definition of photosynthesis is the process through which plants use water and carbon dioxide to create their food, grow and release excess oxygen into the air."
3109,"In photosynthetic organisms, NADPH is produced by ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase in the last step of the electron chain of the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is used as reducing power for the biosynthetic reactions in the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide. "
3110,"NADPH. During the Light Dependent Cycle of photosynthesis, light is absorbed by the chlorophyll. The electrons are excited, which starts them moving from one enzyme to another. A hydrogen atom attaches itself to an NADP molecule, converting it to NADPH."
3111,"NADPH is the source of electrons for glucose biosynthesis. C. ATP is the energy source for glucose biosynthesis. ~ , an electron acceptor, provides reducing power via energized electrons to the Calvin cycle. Water is split in the process, and O2 is released as a by-product. "
3112,"Energy from sunlight, water absorbed by the roots, and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere produce glucose and oxygen by photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other things make food. It is a chemical process that uses sunlight to turn carbon dioxide into sugars the cell can use as energy."
3113,"This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek φῶς, phōs, light, and σύνθεσις, synthesis, putting together. In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide."
3114,"Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, some bacteria and some protistans use the energy from sunlight to produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water. This glucose can be converted into pyruvate which releases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by cellular respiration. Oxygen is also formed."
3115,"Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, convert NADP into NADPH which is then used in the light-independent reactions. Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis and ATP is synthesized from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This all happens in the grana of chloroplasts. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other things make food. It is a chemical process that uses sunlight to turn carbon dioxide into sugars the cell can use as energy."
3116,"The NAD carries a Phosphate in the form of NADP, and at some point releases it to ADP to convert it to ATP. The Hydrogen ions resulting from the split of the water molecule is also carried by NADP in the form of NADPH. NADPH goes to the Calvin cycle. The Hydrogens are released by the NADPH (converting it back to NADP) and can be used to produce a carbohydrate in the Calvin cycle."
3117,"NADPH is reduced NADP (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and is used as a reducing agent. NADPH oxidises to form NADP. In plants, NADP is reduced in the last step of the electron chain of the light reactions of photosynthesis. The NADPH produced is then used as a reducing agent in the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis.

3127,Intervertebral disk. An intervertebral disk acts as shock absorber between each of the vertebrae in the spinal column by keeping the vertebrae separated when there is impact from activity. They also serve to protect the nerves that run down the middle of the spine and intervertebral disks. The disks are made of fibrocartilaginous material. The outside of the disk is made of a strong material called the annulus fibrosus. Inside this protective covering is a jelly-like substance known as mucoprotein gel. This interior is known as the nucleus pulposus.
3128,"Cervical vertebra with intervertebral disc. Discs consist of an outer fibrous ring, the anulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis, which surrounds an inner gel-like center, the nucleus pulposus. The anulus fibrosus consists of several layers (laminae) of fibrocartilage made up of both type I and type II collagen. The intervertebral disc space is typically defined on an X-ray photograph as the space between adjacent vertebrae. In healthy patients, this corresponds to the size of the intervertebral disc. The size of the space can be altered in pathological conditions such as discitis (infection of the intervertebral disc)."
3129,"The annulus fibrosus encloses the nucleus pulposus. Although both the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus are composed of water, collagen, and proteoglycans (PGs), the amount of fluid (water and PGs) is greatest in the nucleus pulposus. PG molecules are important because they attract and retain water. Annulus Fibrosus and Nucleus Pulposus. Intervertebral discs are composed of an annulus fibrosus and a nucleus pulposus. The annulus fibrosus is a strong radial tire–like structure made up of lamellae; concentric sheets of collagen fibers connected to the vertebral end plates. The sheets are orientated at various angles."
3130,"A intervertebral disc disorder is a condition that involves deterioration, herniation, or other dysfunction of an intervertebral disc. As people age, the nucleus pulposus begins to dehydrate, which limits its ability to transfer and distribute loads between the vertebrae. "
3131,"The intervertebral disc functions to separate the vertebrae from each other and provides the surface for the shock-absorbing gel of the nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus of the disc functions to distribute hydraulic pressure in all directions within each intervertebral disc under compressive loads. The intervertebral disc space is typically defined on an X-ray photograph as the space between adjacent vertebrae. In healthy patients, this corresponds to the size of the intervertebral disc. The size of the space can be altered in pathological conditions such as discitis (infection of the intervertebral disc)."

An intervertebral disc, which separates joining vertebrae, is fastened to the roughened upper and lower surfaces of the drum-shaped bodies of the vertebrae. A typical vertebra has a drum-shaped body (centrum) that forms a thick, anterior portion of the bone."
3133,"An intervertebral disc (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together. The intervertebral disc space is typically defined on an X-ray photograph as the space between adjacent vertebrae. In healthy patients, this corresponds to the size of the intervertebral disc.

3135,"The octet rule is actually quite a lousy rule that works consistently only for C,N,O and F (and H using 2 electrons instead of 8) For other elements, like S, P etc, they can have expanded valence shells or electron deficient shells (like Be) which don't obey the octet rule. Let's give an example. Draw the Lewis structure of water (H2O) First we identify how many valence electrons we have-this will be (1x2 + 6) = 8 valence electrons. Now we draw it H-O - H. This implies two bonds (so four electrons in bonding), leaving 2 lone pairs. Well octet rule tells us it is optimal for O to have a total of 8 valence electrons around it. It already has 4 from the 2 bonding pairs, so we add 2 lone pairs to O to make 8. What about CO2? Begin with valence electrons: (4+2x6) = 16 valence electrons Let's start with O-C - O."
3136,"Octet rule explains the formation of ions from atoms. Consider for example, sodium. It has 11 electrons, 2 in the innermost shell, 8 in the next and 1 in the outermost shell. The outermost electron is easy to remove, so that when energy is added to the sodium atom, a sodium ion with one positive charge is easily formed. "
3137,"Explain the octet rule and give an example of how it is used. The electron configurations of the noble gases are extremely stable. The octet rule states that, in chemical reactions, elements gain or lose electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration. When oxygen reacts to form ionic compounds, it completes its octet by gaining two electrons from the element it reacts with. These two electrons add to the p orbital of oxygen, giving it the electron configuration (1s 2s 2p) of neon."
3138,"Many elements are not chemically stable by themselves; by sharing electrons, an atom gains stability. In a chemical formula, the octet rule strongly governs the number of atoms for each element in a molecule; for example, calcium fluoride is CaF2 because two fluorine atoms and one calcium satisfy the rule. For the carbon dioxide molecule, for example, one carbon atom bonds with two oxygen atoms. Carbon, with four electrons in its valence shell, needs four to reach the octet state. Oxygen, with six outer electrons, needs two."
3139,"The Octet Rule says that atoms will usually gain, lose, or share electrons in order to have a total of 8 electrons in their outer shell. An exception to this rule are free rad … icals For example, chlorine (Cl) is from Group VII and has 7 valence electrons. The octet rule is a simple rule of thumb that states that atoms tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shells, giving them th … e same electron configuration as a noble gas."
3140,"Explain the octet rule and give an example of how it is used. A15. The electron configuration (filled s and p orbitals s 2 p 6) of the noble gases is extremely stable. In this configuration, repulsion between electrons is minimized and the energy state is, therefore, relatively low. "
3141,"Question and answer. Explain the octet rule and give an example of how it is used. The octet rule is a chemical rule of thumb that states that atoms of low (. magnesium. Ionic bonding is common between pairs of atoms, where one of the pair is a metal (such as sodium) and the second a non-metal (such as chlorine)."
3142,"The Octet Rule says that atoms will usually gain, lose, or share electrons in order to have a total of 8 electrons in their outer shell. An exception to this rule are free radicals. For example, chlorine (Cl) is from Group VII and has 7 valence electrons. It will gain one electron (eg from sodium which loses one electron to form Na+) to form Cl-, which has 8 valence electrons and so fulfills the octet rule and is stable."
3143,"The octet rule is a chemical rule of thumb that reflects observation that atoms of main-group elements tend to combine in such a way that each atom has eight electrons in its valence shell, giving it the same electronic configuration as a noble gas. "
3144,"For most elements, the valence shell takes eight electrons to fill. According to the octet rule, an atom is “complete” when its valence shell has eight electrons; incomplete atoms share electrons and in so doing end up with full valence shells. For the carbon dioxide molecule, for example, one carbon atom bonds with two oxygen atoms. Carbon, with four electrons in its valence shell, needs four to reach the octet state. Oxygen, with six outer electrons, needs two."

These include: 1  The size of the roof. 2  The shape and design of the roof. 3  The types of thatching material used. 4  The type and pattern of ridge used. 5  The height to the ridge. 6  The height to the apex.
3147,"A normal domestic house roof of 350 m2 roof area would take 6 teams about seven days to thatch. How much does it cost?The cost of a thatch roof is dependant primarily on the maximum span of the roof. The greater the span, the higher the cost per square meter."
3148,In short if an average cottage takes 2-3 Thatchers 4 weeks to thatch the wage bill is going to be considerable; if this runs over to 5 or 6 weeks whilst the cost to the thatch owner may not increase the Thatchers earnings will have taken a nose dive.
3149,"Houses, commercial establishments, heritage centers, holiday villages-you name it, we've probably thatched one. There is a practical consideration-the roof should have a slope no less than 45 degrees (12 inches in 12 inches) to aid in the shedding of water."

In the northern areas, they can be found in the tundra, and they will sometimes forage in fields or meadows. Black bears tend to be solitary animals, with the exception of mothers and cubs. The bears usually forage alone, but will tolerate each other and forage in groups if there is an abundance of food in one area."

3387,"The bear nest is called a den.. A black bear's winter den can be as simple as a dirt scrape, as cozy as the hole under an overturned tree's roots, or as secluded as the inside of a one-hundred-foot-tall hollow tree trunk with the entrance in the top of the tree. Sometimes a mother bear will choose a warm dark cave in which to have her babies."
3388,"Female black bears give birth to two or three blind, helpless cubs in mid-winter and nurse them in the den until spring, when all emerge in search of food. The cubs will stay with their very protective mother for about two years. Size relative to a 6-ft (2-m) man: Black bears are North America's most familiar and common bears. They typically live in forests and are excellent tree climbers, but are also found in mountains and swamps. Despite their name, black bears can be blue-gray or blue-black, brown, cinnamon, or even (very rarely) white."
3389,"The term 'bear' describes either male or female bears. Infant bears, male or female, are called 'cubs'. Other terms used in English to indicate the sex of an adult bear are 'boar' (male) or 'sow' (female), as well as 'he-bear' or 'she-bear' (cubs are also sometimes referred to as 'he-cubs' or 'she-cubs'). A group of bears can be referred to as a 'sleuth' or 'sloth'. The adjective, 'ursine' applies to either sex of bear; the word can be traced back to Latin, ursus, meaning 'a bear'. 'A koala might appear to show ursine characteristics, but it is a marsupial, and not related to any species of bear.'."
3390,"Along with the brown bear, it is one of only two of the eight modern bear species not considered globally threatened with extinction by the IUCN. American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears, a behavior common to many species of bears. A small primitive bear called Ursus abstrusus is the oldest known North American fossil member of the genus Ursus, dated to 4.95 mya. This suggests that U. abstrusus may be the direct ancestor of the American black bear, which evolved in North America."
3391,BLACK BEAR CUBS. Baby black bears are born and live in the safety of the mother's den during winter. The average cub litter size is 1 to 3. Babies are born blind. A black bear baby weighs between one half to one pound at birth. 
3392,"Reversals: At the beginning of each accounting period, there is an accounting practice to use reversing entries to cancel out the adjusting/accrual entries that were made to accrue revenues and expenses at the end of the previous accounting period. Understand the difference between accruals and reversals. Recap the earlier discussion we had on accruals and reversals and see the comparison between these two different but related accounting concepts. Understand how the action of accruing results in reversals subsequently in the accounting cycle."
3393,reversing entry. A journal entry made on the first day of a new accounting period to undo the accrual type adjusting entries made prior to the preparation of the financial statements dated one day earlier. 
3394,"You now create the following reversing entry at the beginning of the February accounting period. This leaves the original $18,000 expense in the income statement in January, but now creates a negative $18,000 expense in the income statement in February. But we are not done yet. Two further examples of how to use a reversing entry are: 1  Accrued revenue. 2  You accrue $10,000 of revenue in January, because the company has earned the revenue but has not yet billed it to the customer."
3395,"The reversing entry typically occurs at the beginning of a reporting period. A reversing entry is commonly used in situations when either revenue or expenses were accrued in the preceding period, and you do not want the accruals to remain in the accounting system for another period. Two further examples of how to use a reversing entry are: 1  Accrued revenue. 2  You accrue $10,000 of revenue in January, because the company has earned the revenue but has not yet billed it to the customer."
3396,The reversal of the prior fiscal year accruals in the thirteenth financial accounting period is necessary to prevent the misstatement of the current fiscal year financial data. Asset and liability entries must be reversed with an offsetting entry to the appropriate revenue or expenditure accounts. 
3397,"Answers. Best Answer: You make reversing entries for accruals at year end. An example would be the accruals for salaries owed at year-end but not paid until early January. Let say we owe them 10,000 on December 31 (a Wednesday) but will pay them 15,000 on Friday. It could be that different people are doing both entries so they don't know what the other is doing. Without a reversing entry the journal entry would be Salaries Expense 5,000 Salaries Payable 10,000 Cash 15,000 This assumes that the person making this entry knows about the accrual. More than likely the accrual has not been make yet since it is only January 2nd."
3398,"Reversing accruals cancel the prior month’s accruals. Accrual-based accounting matches revenue and expenses to the current accounting period. Accruals accumulate until an adjusting entry is made. Reversing accruals are optional and can be implemented at any time because they do not affect the financial statements. Accruals can be used to match revenue, expenses and prepaid item"
3399,"Reversing Entries. Reversing entries, or reversing journal entries, are journal entries made at the beginning of an accounting period to reverse or cancel out adjusting journal entries made at the end of the previous accounting period. This is the last step in the accounting cycle. Reversing entries are usually made to simplify bookkeeping in the new year. For example, if an accrued expense was recorded in the previous year, the bookkeeper or accountant can reverse this entry and account for the expense in the new year when it is paid."
3400,"Reversing Entries. When an adjusting entry is made for an expense at the end of the accounting period, it is necessary to keep track of this expense so that the transaction will be allocated properly between the two periods. Reversing entries are a way to handle such transactions. "
3401,"Confidence votes 4.8K. == Answer == Reversing entries are normally done to reverse accruals or estimates when the actual figures are known. Probably the most common is a reversal of a payroll accrual-at the end of Month 1, you accrue for payroll expense incurred but not yet paid (say 3 days). "

To create clean water using this process, seawater or brackish water is pressurized against one surface of the membrane, causing salt-depleted water to move across the membrane, releasing clean water from the low-pressure side."
3462,"More generally, desalination may also refer to the removal of salts and minerals, as in soil desalination, which also happens to be a major issue for agricultural production. Salt water is desalinated to produce fresh water suitable for human consumption or irrigation. One potential by-product of desalination is salt. The Hadera seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant in Israel is the largest of its kind in the world. The project was developed as a build–operate–transfer by a consortium of two Israeli companies: Shikun and Binui, and IDE Technologies."
3463,"Because the process for desalination is the exact opposite, it?s called reverse osmosis, or just RO. A pre-treatment step is required before RO to provide high quality water and reduce membrane fouling. The most common pre-treatment steps include coagulation and filtration or microfiltration. Quick OutlineDesalination is a practical way of making salty water drinkable and it is used widely around the world now, especially in very dry countries and on ships and small islands. The process is quite expensive and it uses a lot of energy."
3464,"The coined term “nuclear desalination” defines production of potable water from seawater in a facility in which a nuclear reactor is used as the source of energy for the desalination process [2] . Electrical and/or thermal energy may be used in the desalination process. Protection from contamination is important, and if energy in the form of heat (hot water or steam) is supplied by a nuclear reactor to a desalination plant with a distillation process (MED or MSF), measures must be taken to avoid any conceivable risk."
3465,"Desalination was first used by Greek sailors in the 4th century BC to evaporate seawater and create drinking water. Today there are two main desalination technologies – membrane (RO) and thermal (MED, MVC and MSF) desalination. Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination uses the principle of osmosis to remove salt and other impurities, by transferring water through a series of semi-permeable membranes. To create clean water using this process, seawater or brackish water is pressurized against one surface of the membrane, causing salt-depleted water to move across the membrane, releasing clean water from the low-pressure side."
3466,Desalination means the removal of salts and minerals in either ocean or brackish water and make it safe for human consumption and use. Many methods for water purification and seawater desalinization have been used for a number of years starting in ancient times with good old fashion distillation (boil the wat … er and catch the condensate leaving the bad stuff behind). The leading method now is membrane based...reverse osmosis.

Hypernyms (desalination is a kind of...): chemical action; chemical change; chemical process ((chemistry) any process determined by the atomic and molecular composition and structure of the substances involved).
3468,"A. Desalination means removing salt from saline (salty) water. Sea water is the basic source of water for our planet. But we can not use it for drinking or other domestic purposes because it is too salty. Desalination renders sea water usable for human inhabitation. A. Reverse osmosis is the most energy-efficient process in comparison with the other two desalination processes, namely, distillation and freeze-thawing. It takes certain minimum amount of mechanical energy, also known as free energy to remove one gallon of water from saline solution."
3469,"Since heat is vital in thermal desalination, the process is often linked to power plants and refineries to use waste heat. There are three main types of thermal desalination – vapour compression (VC), multi-effect distillation (MED) and multi-stage flash distillation (MSF). To create clean water using this process, seawater or brackish water is pressurized against one surface of the membrane, causing salt-depleted water to move across the membrane, releasing clean water from the low-pressure side."

3479,"Vegetative reproduction is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants where new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores by meiosis or syngamy. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants."
3480,"Asexual reproduction requires only one parent. Since there is only one parent, there is no exchanging of genetic information, and the offspring are clones of the parent. Asexual reproduction in plants can occur in a variety of forms, including budding, vegetative propagation, and fragmentation."
3481,"Asexual reproduction in liverworts: a caducous phylloid germinating. Asexual reproduction is a mode of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single organism, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it does not involve the fusion of gametes and almost never changes the number of chromosomes. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants."
3482,"Asexual Reproduction. Asexual reproduction is advantageous in allowing beneficial combinations of characteristics to continue unchanged and in eliminating the often vulnerable stages of early embryonic growth. It is found in most plants, bacteria, and protists and the lower invertebrates. "
3483,"Why does sex -- that is, sexual reproduction -- exist? In many ways, asexual reproduction is a better evolutionary strategy: Only one parent is required, and all of that parent's genes are passed on to its progeny. In sexual reproduction, only half of each parent's genes are passed to the next generation. "
3484,"Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Sexual reproduction allows traits that are adaptive/beneficial to spread through a population and species fairly quickly. It also allows 2 or more beneficial traits that have evolved independently in 2 or more individuals to be passed along to the same descendants. Sexual reproduction also promotes genetic diversity, so that a population is less susceptible in case of disease epidemics. For example, when the plague hit Europe, some individuals by chance had mutations that allowed them to survive, and they did."
3485,Posted on. (Answer #2). The sexual reproduction is beneficial for the population due to the following reasons: 1. The environment is constantly changing and there need the change of the characteristics to sustain in the changing environment. 2. 
3486,Another reason why sexual reproduction is so beneficial is that it is better at combating disease. If a parent has a disease like Huntington's disease and that person reproduces with someone who doesn't have the disease there is a chance that when they reproduce the child will not have the disease. Why Sexual Reproduction is Better than Asexual Reproduction. I feel like a good place to start is with an investigation to understand why sexual reproduction is better than asexual r

3524,"Thus, there must be a balance between a high SSA and an operationally reliable biofilter media. Nitrifying bacteria cells grow on all surfaces of the biological filter media and, in fact, on all wet surfaces of the system, such as the insides of pipes, tank walls, etc. 1 Water quality parameters should be monitored regularly during the start-up of a biofilter. 2  Ammonia, nitrite, pH, temperature and alkalinity are the primary water quality parameters to test. 3  Reliable, accurate and repeatable methods for measuring ammonia and nitrite concentrations in the system should be established."
3525,"Biofilter media moisture control is essential for odor reduction through a biofilter. Inadequate moisture can allow the media to dry out, deactivating the microbes, and creating cracks and channeling of air which results in a reduction of filter efficiency.

Plant spores are produced by the organisms we can usually recognize. The major types of plants that form spores are algae, mosses, and ferns. Algae are the simplest of these plants, and can range from tiny, single celled things to large, multi-celled plants that cover your backyard pond."
3547,Spores are tiny single cells that are produced by fungi that have hyphae. They can be produced asexually by a process in which the tips of the hyphae form specially encased cells – the spores. Some fungi also produce spores sexually. Two types of special cells called gametes are produced. One of each type unite to produce a new individual spore.

Then wait 3 days for a reaction. It is important that if you have a bad, long lasting reaction, wait until you are back to feeling how you were on the protocol before moving on.

There is no real average as the bpm varies greatly on the type of music. Rock music temds to be at about 120 (BPM), and a slow waltz 90. House music is faster than Rock, around 120-128 bpm, Jungle still faster at 150-180 bpm."
3618,"Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute when textbooks asserted that the normal range for heart rates was 60–100 BPM. The normal range has since been revised in textbooks to 50–90 BPM for a human at total rest. Normal resting heart rates range from 60–100 bpm. Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm. However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention."
3619,"You can tell how fast your heart is beating (your heart rate) by feeling your pulse. Your heart-rate is the amount of times your heart beats in one minute. You will need a watch with a second hand. Place your index and middle finger of your hand on the inner wrist of the other arm, just below the base of the thumb. You should feel a tapping or pulsing against your fingers."
3620,"The answer, as we've seen before, is in the music's BPM (beats per minute). This chart helps you find the right BPM to look for in a song depending on how you run. Previously we've noted that the best exercise music is between 120-140 BPM, but the right range for you may actually depend on what type of exercise you do and personal factors like your stride length."
3621,"What counts as an abnormally slow heartbeat for one person may not be the same for another. For example, a young, strong, healthy athlete may have a resting heart rate of 30-40 beats per minute, but may easily increase his heart rate to 180 beats per minute with exercise. This is normal. 1 Tachy-brady syndrome– It is possible for the same person to have a slow heartbeat when the heart is in normal rhythm and periods of fast, irregular heartbeats (supraventricular tachycardias) at other times. 2  Sometimes, medications needed to control the fast heart rate can worsen the already slow heart rate."
3622,"Answer by Roger70 (107). There is no real average as the bpm varies greatly on the type of music. Rock music temds to be at about 120 (BPM), and a slow waltz 90. House music is faster than Rock, around 120-128 bpm, Jungle still faster at 150-180 bpm. In the 40s and 50s, fast Bebop had high bpm, with some performed at 380 BPM"
3623,"Slow Heartbeat. Slow heartbeat (heart rate), called bradycardia, is an arrhythmia, or disorder of the heart’s rhythm. Each day, a normal heart beats about 100,000 times, at a rate any­where from 60 to 100 times a minute. Changes in heart rate caused by activity, diet, medications, and age are normal and common. 1 Tachy-brady syndrome– It is possible for the same person to have a slow heartbeat when the heart is in normal rhythm and periods of fast, irregular heartbeats (supraventricular tachycardias) at other times. 2  Sometimes, medications needed to control the fast heart rate can worsen the already slow heart rate."
3624,"How fast the heart beats depends on the body's need for oxygen-rich blood. At rest, the SA node causes your heart to beat about 50 to 100 times each minute. During activity or excitement, your body needs more oxygen-rich blood; the heart rate rises to well over 100 beats per minute. Your heart-rate is the amount of times your heart beats in one minute. You will need a watch with a second hand. Place your index and middle finger of your hand on the inner wrist of the other arm, just below the base of the thumb. You should feel a tapping or pulsing against your fingers."
3625,"Beats per minute (BPM) is a unit typically used as a measure of tempo in music and heart rate. The BPM tempo of a piece of music is conventionally shown in its score as a metronome mark, as illustrated to the right. This indicates that every one minute there should be 120 quarter notes (or crotchets). For example, a tempo of 60 beats per minute signifies one beat per second, while a tempo of 120 beats per minute is twice as rapid, signifying one beat every 0.5 seconds."
3626,"The normal resting adult human heart rate ranges from 60–100 bpm. Tachycardia is a fast heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest. Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. During sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40–50 BPM is common and is considered normal. When the heart is not beating in a regular pattern, this is referred to as an arrhythmia. These abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease. Normal resting heart rates range from 60–100 bpm. Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm. However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention."
3627,"As your puppy gets older, you may be tempted to leave him alone for longer and longer periods. Your puppy can likely hold his bladder for 7-8 hours now and many of his bad habits, such as destroying the couch or the crate pad, may be behind him. "
3628,"Here are a few simple steps to make your puppy comfortable home alone: 1  Start by introducing your dog to his crate. 2  Crate him for short periods while you are present and gradually increase the time crated. 3  Reward quiet behaviour with calm praise and perhaps a treat such as a piece of dog food. 1 Crate him for short periods while you are present and gradually increase the time crated. 2  Reward quiet behaviour with calm praise and perhaps a treat such as a piece of dog food. 3  Start leaving your puppy alone. 4  At first, just a few minutes at a time and then gradually increase it."
3629,"There’s not a standard time when you can first leave your puppy home alone. But ideally, you won’t leave him alone for hours at a time in the first few days. However, few of us can take time off from work to help a new puppy or dog adjust to our schedule. Get Set Up. First, make sure that you have a puppy-safe area for your pup to stay home alone. Remember that puppies pee, poop, chew and climb, so your pup should be in a pen or mostly empty small room (bathroom or laundry room) with a secure door or gate. Leave plenty of proper chew toys and, of course, water."
3630,"Preparing your Puppy for staying Home Alone. Many people have a problem leaving their dogs alone at home, because the dogs suffer from separation anxiety which manifests in a variety of problem behaviours such as house-soiling, destructive chewing, digging, howling, barking or self-mutilation."
3631,"So before leaving your puppy for long periods, you should teach him how to amuse himself appropriately when left alone, such as by chewing stuffed chewtoys, and learning how to enjoy his own company without becoming anxious or stressed. To teach your puppy how to settle down calmly and quietly when you are absent, start by teaching him to settle down with a chewtoy at times when you are present. A dog is not like a television or a video game."
3632,Don't worry. Just because you have a dog now doesn't mean that you'll be stuck at home for the next decade. You have a lot of options for when you need to leave your puppy alone. She can stay inside or outside. You can confine her in a room or let her roam around. You can tie her up or fence her in
3633,"So a 3 month old puppy can hold it for 3 hours, a 4 month old for 4 hours, etc. At about 6 to 8 months your dog should be able to hold his potty for an entire night. During the day it is different though, and each dog is different. You need to be aware of your puppy’s potty habits. After a while, your dog should get used to the routine of taking potty breaks in the morning before you leave, once during the afternoon, in the evening when you come home, and once again before bed. When your dog grows to be an adult, he should be able to hold off going to the bathroom for about 8 hours"
3634,"I have a 3 month old puppy and we got him at the age of 6 weeks. He can be left alone for up to 5 hours, as long as he doesn't miss a meal it is absolutely fine, but that's because we started getting him used to it at a young age. The longer you leave it the more chance there is of your dog being destructive."
3635,"Although it's essential to consistently supervise your puppy during the house-training process, there's bound to be a time when you must leave him home alone for four hours. Walk your puppy about one hour before leaving him alone. Take him outside so he can go potty and play a game of fetch so he can run and have fun. A good exercise session can help keep him calm while you're away. It might tire him out so he decides to take a nap."

3646,"Eating marijuana affects you differently than smoking it, so walk before you run is the moral of this story. When you eat marijuana, it goes into your blood stream, compared to when you smoke marijuana and it goes into your nervous system. When you eat it, the high lasts longer, and takes longer to take effect. When you smoke marijuana, the high is almost instant, but doesn’t last as long as when you eat marijuana."
3647,"1. 20. Yes. You get high when you eat marijuana. But it usually takes longer and is not as intense as inhaling marijuana smoke. But the high lasts longer, and is highly detectable in urine after eating it.Marijuana is usually smoked in a pipe or cigarette but can also be mixed in baked goods and ingested orally as a pill or capsule (dronabinol or oral THC)."
3648,"There is no metabolite in weed. Metabolites are what you get when your metabolism breaks down a substance. Weed contains THC and other cannabinoids. They don't need to be liberated. You don't need heat. If you could get it down, you could eat raw weed and get as high as a kite."
3649,"I've heard that the best way to get high from ingesting THC oraly is by cooking out the THC in oil and butter. That doesn't mean that you wont get high if u eat raw weed because you will. It will take longer for you to feel and, depending on how much you eat, how high you get."
3650,"To reiterate, the plant does not need to contain high levels of THC and it can simply be hemp. Eating Cannabis that does contain THC will not get you high. Also, smoking it does not give the same results as eating or juicing the plant."
3651,"So you can add cannabis to any food that contains animal or vegetable fats, such as cakes, biscuits, stews or drinks such as milkshakes, drinking chocolate or yoghourts."
3652,"You can't get high just by swallowing a bud of weed, no. You would have to chew the bud, extracting the THC through saliva, and pressure. Since THC (the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) is fat-soluble, the marijuana should first be cooked in a fatty substance such as butter or oil."
3653,"N. The Silurian is a geologic period and system that extends from the end of the Ordovician Period, at 443.8 ± 1.5 million years ago (mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period. "
3654,"The Paleozoic Era, which ran from about 542 million years ago to 251 million years ago, was a time of great change on Earth. The era began with the breakup of one supercontinent and the formation of another. Plants became widespread. And the first vertebrate animals colonized land. Life in the Paleozoic. "
3655,"The Silurian Period follows the Ordovician Period in the Paleozoic Era. It began around 443 million years ago and lasted for 26 million years. Like the periods that have come before, it is named for an ancient Celtic tribe that lived in Wales where the geologic evidence was found. Silurian Climate. "
3656,"The Rise of The Cephalopods. The Ordovician Period is the second period of the Paleozoic Era. Ordovician rocks were first found in Wales, so its name comes from a tribe of people who once lived in the area where the rocks were found. The Ordovician began about 490 million years ago and lasted for about 47 million years. The Continents-Gondwanaland. Gondwana was a huge supercontinent during the Ordovician Period. It contained the modern continents of Australia, Africa, Southern Europe, Antarctica and South America"
3657,"The Ordovician Period. The Ordovician Period lasted almost 45 million years, beginning 488.3 million years ago and ending 443.7 million years ago.* During this period, the area north of the tropics was almost entirely ocean, and most of the world's land was collected into the southern supercontinent Gondwana. The Ordovician is best known for its diverse marine invertebrates, including graptolites, trilobites, brachiopods, and the conodonts (early vertebrates). A typical marine community consisted of these animals, plus red and green algae, primitive fish, cephalopods, corals, crinoids, and gastropods."
3658,"The Silurian Period occurred from 443 million to 416 million years ago. It was the third period in the Paleozoic Era. It followed the Ordovician Period and preceded the Devonian Period. During this time, continental landmasses were low and sea levels were rising. "
3659,"Though Ordovician life sounds primitive by today's standards, the life during this period was more advanced than life in the earlier Cambrian Period. Ordovician life was characterized by a dramatic increase of the shelly fauna, corals, and bryozoans. By the end of the Ordovician Period, primitive jawless fish called Ostracoderms appeared. These primitive fish were covered with bony plates and were among the first vertebrates on the earth. The following image shows how the earth looked approximately 450 Million Years ago, during the Late Ordovician Period."
3660,"During the Ordovician Period, the surface of the earth was dramatically different than it is today. Nearly all life on earth was in the oceans. The only land life was in the form of very primitive plants very near the water line of the coasts, probably mosses and algae and were of a non-vascular nature. By the end of the Ordovician Period, primitive jawless fish called Ostracoderms appeared. These primitive fish were covered with bony plates and were among the first vertebrates on the earth. The following image shows how the earth looked approximately 450 Million Years ago, during the Late Ordovician Period."
3661,"It is also in the Silurian that we find the first clear evidence of life on land. While it is possible that plants and animals first moved onto the land in the Ordovician, fossils of terrestrial life from that period are fragmentary and difficult to interpret. Silurian strata have provided likely ascomycete fossils (a group of fungi), as well as remains of the first arachnids and centipedes."

3686,"Cellular respiration is the process by which the chemical energy of food molecules is released and partially captured in the form of ATP. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be used as fuels in cellular respiration, but glucose is most commonly used as an example to examine the reactions and pathways involved. In glycolysis, the 6-carbon sugar, glucose, is broken down into two molecules of a 3-carbon molecule called pyruvate. The energy released is captured in the form of ATP (3 ATP per NADH and 2 ATP per FADH 2). The electron transport chain (ETC) consists of a series of molecules, mostly proteins, embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The glucose required for cellular respiration is produced by plants."
3687,In glycolysis 2 molecules of ATP are used up and 4 are produced (so a net production of 2 ATP molecules) The pyruvate then continues through Kreb's cycle and then the products from that enter the ETC (which is where most of the ATP is produced) So glucose is the starting molecule for cellular respiration. 
3688,"The first major step of cellular respiration is the anaerobic (meaning that it doesn't require oxygen) process of glycolysis. Here the glucose is modified into a molecule of pyruvate, which after further modification ends up donating particles in order to fuel the production of ATP out of ADP and phosphate. Digestion. Most glucose is apprehended by the body through the digestion of complex carbohydrates. It is carried through the body by blood (which is the origin of the term blood sugar level) and arrives at the cell so that it can enter the process of cellular respiration."
3689,"Glucose. Glucose is a simple carbohydrate and the primary molecular input that initially enters the process of cellular respiration. Its purpose, in this respect, is to produce the molecule ATP, the main energy storage and transfer unit of a cell. Digestion. Most glucose is apprehended by the body through the digestion of complex carbohydrates. It is carried through the body by blood (which is the origin of the term blood sugar level) and arrives at the cell so that it can enter the process of cellular respiration."
3690,"Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water. C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O → 12H2O + 6 CO2. The energy released is trapped in the form of ATP for use by all the energy-consuming activities of the cell. 1  glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid. 2  the complete oxidation of pyruvic acid to carbon dioxide and water."
3691,"During cellular respiration, the energy in glucose is converted, into 40 (38 net) ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules, these are then used to carry out life's functions, su … ch as homeostasis. The point of cellular respiration  is to break down this molecule and conv … ert its energy into ATP  which is the usable energy of the cell.

Essentially, the glucose  provides the source of the fuel that runs cellular activities."
3693,"Glycolysis is the first step in cellular respiration for both anaerobic and aerobic processes. Glycolysis takes place in the cytosol of a cell. In the cytosol we convert 1 molecule of glucose into 2 molecules of pyruvate. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells get their energy in the form of ATP. There are two types of cellular respiration, aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic respiration is more efficient and can be utilized in the presence of oxygen, while anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen."

The Congress of Vienna was a conference of ambassadors of European states chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, and held in Vienna from September 1814 to June 1815. The Congress of Vienna settlement, despite later changes, formed the framework for European international politics until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914."
3696,"The Congress of Vienna limited the French power and restored the French monarchy that had been overthrown during the French Revolution. During the meeting, Russia, Prussia, Austria, Great Britain and France took many steps to make the weak countries around France stronger. However, not only did the Congress of Vienna try to restore balance of power but also to prevent nationalism and liberalism, contain France, bring back legitimate rulers of Europe and stop slave trade in Europe."

3723,"Making the world better, one answer at a time. Blood brain barrier is formed by specific nueroglial cells called astrocytes.These astrocytes are of two types :1) Fibrous astrocytes and 2) protoplasmic astrocytes. The fibres of these astrocytes forms a network with capillaries of blood vessels that supply blood to brain. "
3724,"The blood–brain barrier is formed by brain endothelial cells, which are connected by tight junctions with an extremely high electrical resistivity of at least 0.1 ω⋅m. The BBB is distinct from the quite similar blood–cerebrospinal-fluid barrier, which is a function of the choroidal cells of the choroid plexus, and from the blood–retinal barrier, which can be considered a part of the whole realm of such barriers. Several areas of the human brain are not on the brain side of the BBB."
3725,The blood–brain barrier regulates brain extracellular fluid. Brain capillaries form a tight barrier except in specialised areas. Tight junctions restrict paracellular movement of substances across the blood–brain barrier. Astrocytes contribute to differentiation of the blood–brain barrier. Transport across the blood–brain barrier may be passive or active.
3726,"The barrier function of the blood–brain barrier is due to: (1) tight junctions that restrict movement of substances between the endothelial cells, (2) specific transport proteins that determine which substances can cross the barrier transcellularly and (3) enzymes that may degrade or alter substances prior to passage. Brain capillaries form a tight barrier except in specialised areas. Tight junctions restrict paracellular movement of substances across the blood–brain barrier. Astrocytes contribute to differentiation of the blood–brain barrier. Transport across the blood–brain barrier may be passive or active."
3727,"blood-brain barrier, n barrier formed by epithelial cells in the capillaries that supply the brain and central nervous system. This barrier selectively allows entry of substances such as glucose, some ions, and oxygen, while blocking entry of other substances. "
3728,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a diffusion barrier, which impedes influx of most compounds from blood to brain. Three cellular elements of the brain microvasculature compose the BBB-endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, and pericytes (PCs). Tight junctions (TJs), present between the cerebral endothelial cells, form a diffusion barrier, which selectively excludes most blood-borne substances from entering the brain. "
3729,"The blood–brain barrier occurs along all capillaries and consists of tight junctions around the capillaries that do not exist in normal circulation. The BBB is distinct from the quite similar blood–cerebrospinal-fluid barrier, which is a function of the choroidal cells of the choroid plexus, and from the blood–retinal barrier, which can be considered a part of the whole realm of such barriers. Several areas of the human brain are not on the brain side of the BBB."
3730,The blood–brain barrier consists of endothelial cells lining brain capillaries. It serves to restrict and control the movement of substances between the general circulation and brain extracellular fluid. Brain capillaries form a tight barrier except in specialised areas. Tight junctions restrict paracellular movement of substances across the blood–brain barrier. Astrocytes contribute to differentiation of the blood–brain barrier. Transport across the blood–brain barrier may be passive or active.

3777,"1 To get the best head start, turn over your pea planting beds in the fall, add manure to the soil, and mulch well. 2  As with other legumes, pea roots will fix nitrogen in the soil, making it available for other plants. 3  Peas will appreciate a good sprinkling of wood ashes to the soil before planting. Next spring, plant peas early (in March even if there's snow as long as it's not soggy), Watch carefully for mildew (whitish color) and spray a mix of 9 parts water to 1 part powered milk to avoid this problem. Also,be sure to water peas early in the day and water at the soil line not overhead to avoiding wet leaves."

The sea caves along the Na Pali Coast are formed from the harsh wave action of the Pacific Ocean slamming into the porous lava. At 1,155 feet in length, the Waiahuakua Sea Cave is second on the list in rank for the world’s longest sea caves. This dark and spooky sea cave has a separate entrance and exit, and is thus referred to as the Double-Door Cave."
3800,"Areas known for large concentrations of sea caves include the Pacific coast states of the USA (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California, and especially, California's Channel Islands); the Na Pali coast of Kauai; the Greek Isles; the British Isles, and many other places with cliffs of good solid rock to host the caves. Regions where sea caves form are often associated with arches and sea stacks. Often these are remnants from collapses of sea caves, and in some cases may line up along what had been a fault line in a rock unit that has been carved by the sea into isolated stacks of rock."

A special case is littoral caves, which are formed by wave action in zones of weakness in sea cliffs. Often these weaknesses are faults, but they may also be dykes or bedding-plane contacts. Some wave-cut caves are now above sea level because of later uplift. Elsewhere, in places such as Thailand's Phang Nga Bay, solutional caves have been flooded by the sea and are now subject to littoral erosion. Sea caves are generally around 5 to 50 metres (16 to 164 ft) in length, but may exceed 300 metres (980 ft)."

Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, fish, and meat (especially liver). By far the most important provitamin A carotenoid is beta-carotene; other provitamin A carotenoids are alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. "
3818,"In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol) in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal. Vitamin A is a group of unsaturated nutritional organic compounds, that includes retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and several provitamin A carotenoids, and beta-carotene.

3849,"If you visit Turkey during the winter season, you can order salep, a hot beverage in many cafes. Salep is a milk and flower based hot drink made of wild orchid powder. Salep has been extracted from the tubers of various kinds of Orchis."
3850,"SALEP Dosing. The appropriate dose of salep depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for salep."
3851,"When does implantation occur is a basic question that every woman trying to get pregnant asks herself. Implantation is a process in which fertilised egg attaches itself to the uterus wall. This process occurs at the beginning of a pregnancy. In this process, once the egg has been fertilised by sperm, it moves through the fallopian tubes and reaches the uterus. Implantation may occur after just a few hours or days after fertilisation. When you’re trying to conceive, the waiting period that comes after ovulation can be quite frustrating and annoying."
3852,"Usually, the egg will be implanted between 6 to 12 days of egg retrieval. After five days of embryo transfer, the egg reaches blastocyst stage. For accuracy, you need to county the day of retrieval as day 0. In this process, once the egg has been fertilised by sperm, it moves through the fallopian tubes and reaches the uterus. Implantation may occur after just a few hours or days after fertilisation. When you’re trying to conceive, the waiting period that comes after ovulation can be quite frustrating and annoying."
3853,Embryo transfer is a simple procedure that follows in vitro fertilization (IVF) and is often considered the simplest and final step of the in vitro fertilization process. The objective of embryo transfer is to facilitate conception following fertilization from the in vitro fertilization procedure. 
3854,"If conception occurred, implantation (when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine wall) typically happens seven to ten days after ovulation, but it can happen a few days earlier or later as well. There are some signs of implantation or successful conception that may be seen on your chart but all of them can occur with or without pregnancy. You can also be pregnant and see none of these signs on your chart."
3855,"1 Implantation occurs on day 6-10 after the egg retrieval. 2  Which is 1 to 5 days after a blastocyst transfer. 3  Which is equivalent to day 20-24 of a natural menstrual cycle (idealized 28 day cycle). Embryo implantation in humans. After fertilization the human embryo begins a 4 day long journey down the fallopian tube and into the uterus. When the embryo reaches the blastocyst stage it develops two distinct populations of cells. The outer cell mass,called the trophectoderm, and the inner cell mass."
3856,"Implantation typically occurs 6 to 10 days after ovulation, or day 20 to 24 of a menstrual cycle. However, it can happen a few days earlier or later. In an average 28-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 14 with the first day of a woman's period being considered day 1 in a cycle. "
3857,"Implantation or the attachment of the fertilized egg to the uterine wall is a process that is essential for pregnancy. Normally, the fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterine wall 6 to 12 days after ovulation. The following write-up will provide more information on this subject. Those who do, may experience bleeding 7-10 days after fertilization. It could last for a few minutes to even for a week. In case of women who have opted for IVF, bleeding may take place a week after egg retrieval. Implantation bleeding is one of the early signs of"
3858,"There may be a chance that your implantation starts at 6 to 10 days after the egg transferred, so the thing is that you have to be calm and may not pay so much attention at the implantation timing and implantation symptoms and signs. This time calculation started at the time when blastocyst has transferred. Some times it is not the appropriate case that at the exact 1 to 5 days you are watching or getting the symptoms of implantation, such as heavy implantation bleeding which is an most common sign of implantation."
3859,"We mean it. Implantation takes place between 1 and 5 days after a blastocyst transfer. If you didn’t have a day-5 transfer, your implantation window is 6 to 10 days after egg retrieval. Take that week off. There’s no hard evidence to suggest being home alone helps – but research isn’t everything."
3860,The diaphragm is the dome-shaped sheet of muscle and tendon that serves as the main muscle of respiration and plays a vital role in the breathing process.
3861,"Primary and Secondary Muscles Used in Respiration. Inspiration. The primary muscles used in inspiration include diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. The secondary muscles used in inspiration include the sternocloidomastoid and scalini. Expiration. The primary muscle involved in expiration is the diaphragm. The secondary muscles involved in expiration include the internal and external intercostals, external oblique, internal oblique, transverse abdoninal and rectus abdominis. These are the muscles which become fatigued in the severe asthmatic patient."
3862,"Muscles of Respiration. During quiet breathing, the predominant muscle of respiration is the diaphragm. As it contracts, pleural pressure drops, which lowers the alveolar pressure, and draws air in down the pressure gradient from mouth to alveoli."
3863,"8. The last component of the respiratory system is a muscle structure known as the muscles of respiration. These muscles surround the lungs and allow the inhalation and exhalation of air. The main muscle in this system is known as the diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle that constitutes the bottom of the thorax."
3864,Breathing is an active process-requiring the contraction of skeletal muscles. The primary muscles of respiration include the external intercostal muscles (located between the ribs) and the diaphragm (a sheet of muscle located between the thoracic & abdominal cavities).
3865,3 Muscles of Respiration There are four primary muscle groups that are involved in respiration. Diaphragm (Phrenic Nerve C 3 -C 8) The diaphragm is the primary muscle responsible for inspiration (breathing in).
3866,"A chemical formula identifies each constituent element by its chemical symbol and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element. In empirical formulas, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, as ratios to the key element. A chemical formula is not a chemical name, and it contains no words. Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical structural formula."
3867,"A chemical formula is a representation of the elements in a molecule. Although the word formula connotes an equation, chemical formula are not to be confused with chemical equations, which describe multiple molecules at once. Molecular Formula. The molecular chemical formula uses subscripts to count the number of elements in a molecule, e.g. H2O, where the 2 is a subscript. One variant is to clump element symbols together in the order they appear in the molecule, e.g. CH3-O-CH3 or CH3OCH3, instead of C2H6O."
3868,"The chemical formula provides a lot of information about a chemical substance-how many atoms and what atoms it is made up of, even the way the atoms are arranged. In this lesson, we will discuss the different types of chemical formulas. This information can be gathered from the chemical formula of the substance. A compound is a substance made up of a definite proportion of two or more elements. A chemical formula tells us the number of atoms of each element in a compound. It contains the symbols of the atoms of the elements present in the compound, as well as how many there are for each element in the form of subscript"
3869,"A chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus (+) and minus (−) signs. A chemical formula is not a chemical name, and it contains no words. Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical structural formula."
3870,"Chemical formula of glucose showing the bonds between atoms. A chemical formula (or molecular formula) is one way chemists describe a molecule. The formula says what atoms, and how many of each type, are in the molecule. The letter shows what chemical element each atom is. The subscript shows the number of each type of atom. For example, hydrogen peroxide has the formula H 2 O 2. Methane has one carbon (C) atom and four hydrogen atoms; the chemical formula is CH 4."

3873,"About the Oud. The oud (also known as the ud is a musical instrument common to all Arab cultures. It is also an important part of the Turkish musical tradition and may have originated Persia, where it is known as the barbat. It is a stringed instrument slightly smaller than a guitar, with eleven strings in six courses. "
3874,Construction of the oud is similar to that of the lute. The modern oud and the European lute both descend from a common ancestor via diverging paths. One instrument that has been suggested as ancestral is the Barbat. The oud is readily distinguished from the lute by its lack of frets and smaller neck.

3876,"BASICS. THEORY. ARTISTS. MAKERS. GALLERY. LINKS. The oud (or ud) is one of the most popular instruments in Middle Eastern music. Its name derives from the Arabic for 'wood', and this refers to the strips of wood used to make its rounded body. In Greece it is known as the outi and in Iran as the barbat"
3877,"The oud is a pear-shaped, stringed instrument similar to a lute used in traditional Middle Eastern music and East African music. The words lute and oud are both derived from Arabic العود (al-ʿūd, literally the wood). "
3878,"The Oud Instrument. In the Arab origin, Oud is considered to be “the king of instruments”. It is assumed that the name al-oud is derived from the Arabic for “the wood” and came to Europe through North Africa. There will be nothing wrong to say that in Arab, the oud is considered to be the oldest musical instruments. "
3879,"The Oud (Ud). The Oud, a central instrument of Arabic music, is a stringed instrument with an ancient history. It probably originated over 3,500 year ago in Persia, where it was called a Barbat (oud). A similar instrument is shown in Egyptian paintings and was used in the times of the Pharaohs"
3880,"The origin of the name oud (and its etymological cousin, lute) for the musical instrument is uncertain. The Arabic: العود ‎ (al-ʿūd) literally denotes a thin piece of wood similar to the shape of a straw. The oud is readily distinguished from the lute by its lack of frets and smaller neck."

The Majority and Minority Leaders of the House each received $193,400 per year, as of 2012. The U.S. Constitution requires Congress to determine its own pay, but the method of compensation has changed over time. In the early years, Members received a per diem compensation -- pay per day that they worked. The first annual Congressional salaries appeared in 1815."
3883,"1 From 1789 to 1855, members of Congress received only a per diem (daily payment) of $6.00 while in session, except for a period from December 1815 to March 1817, when they received $1,500 a year. 2  Members began receiving an annual salary in 1855, when they were paid $3,000 per year. As it is for all other federal employees, congressional retirement is funded through taxes and the participants' contributions.

3889,"How Long Does Hatching Take. Hatching can take place over several days. For chickens, run the incubator for 24 days (3 days more than normal hatch time). For ducks and turkeys run the incubator for 32 days (4 days more than normal hatch time). It is better not to help a chick/duckling/poult crack out of its shell. If you do, they almost always die (unless you follow the instructions in the next paragraphs). "
3890,Get ready for hatching. The eggs should begin to hatch at day 28. After hatching the chicks will need to dry off at least 75% of the way in the incubator before you move them to the brooder. Start incubator several hours before adding the eggs to make sure the temperature stabilizes at 98–99.9 °F (36.7–37.7 °C) and Humidity at 30-50%. I have found that starting my incubator 24 hours before usually allows plenty of time for all the minor adjustments to be made prior to incubation of the eggs.
3891,"Also while you have the incubator opened, check the humidity inside the incubator. In foam incubators, add a teaspoon or two of water if the humidity is real low. Low being 25%. For 1202's: Open the bator every 4 days or so and add 1/4 inch of water to the pan. If you notice the humidity in the incubator is above 65% add only a tablespoon of water or two. If your incubator humidity is below 65% add about ½ of the channel full of water. Remove the eggs from the turner and lay them flat on their sides. Try to allow a little room between them."
3892,"If, after 6 days, you do not see life or development in any of the eggs, then terminate incubation. Most of the time, a power outage will delay hatching by a few days and decrease the hatchability to 40-50 percent. Humidity The relative humidity of the air within an incubator should be about 60 percent. "
3893,"1. If the incubator is not already in operation, start the incubator and allow the temperature and humidity to stabilize a day or two before setting eggs. Set the temperature at 37.5°C (99.5°F) and relative humidity at 55% (84.5°F on wet bulb thermometer). Set ventilation as recommended by the incubator manufacturer. Eggs from common ducks like Pekins require 28 days to hatch. Eggs from Muscovy ducks hatch in about 35 days after setting. When larger numbers of duck eggs are to be hatched, large commercial incubators (setters) and hatchers are normally used."
3894,"1 Call your local office, and ask them if you can raise these wild ducks from eggs, in an incubator you bought, and release them in exactly 60-90 days, which is their fledging time (how long it takes to fly) to a nearby lake in your town. 2  Notify them that the mother duck has been missing for 48 hours. Start incubator several hours before adding the eggs to make sure the temperature stabilizes at 98–99.9 °F (36.7–37.7 °C) and Humidity at 30-50%.

This is my 2nd attempt at hatching duck eggs as i had no joy on 1st try as they died on day 24 due to temp changes suddenly. I have now got a better incubator and so far all seem... Transfer them into the brooder, with heat lamp, within 12 hours of hatching. When they are 2 weeks old, start decreasing the bulb temp gradually every day, until they are 4 weeks old. Then, they will no longer need to be incubated."

4004,"Moringa oleifera, known popularly as drumstick tree, is a tropical plant grown for its nutritious leafy-greens, flower buds, and mineral-rich green fruit pods. It is a well-recognized member in the Moringaceae family of trees, and thought to be originated in the sub-Himalayan forests of the Indian subcontinent."
4005,"Presenter: Josh Byrne, 23/04/2005. If you wanted to invent a tree you d battle to come up with one as versatile as the drumstick tree Moringa oleifera. Originating from northern India, the leaves, flowers, pods and roots are edible. And it's the drumstick-like pod shape that gives the tree its name."

4007,"Select the range of discount points that you are willing to pay. Discount points are an upfront fee that you pay to get a lower interest rate. One point is 1 percent of the loan amount. On a $100,000 mortgage, if you pay 1 point, you pay an upfront fee of $1,000. Select which type of mortgage you are shopping for: a 30-year fixed-rate loan, a 15-year fixed, an FHA-insured loan, an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) with an introductory rate lasting 5 or 7 years, a 20-year fixed, and 10-year fixed or a 30-year Veterans Affairs loan."
4008,"APR can vary enormously between lenders. For example some payday loan companies may charge over 5000% APR. Whereas regulated Credit unions must charge less than 43% APR. Try putting in a high APR on the first slider and a low APR on the second slider and compare the interest owed. However beware, the APR is more than the monthly rate times 12. The APR is worked out on the basis that you refinance each month for 12 months. When you take out a new loan to pay off the first one-plus any interest-the next month's interest payment is likely to be significantly MORE."
4009,"The payday lending industry argues that conventional interest rates for lower dollar amounts and shorter terms would not be profitable. For example, a $100 one-week loan, at a 20% APR (compounded weekly) would generate only 38 cents of interest, which would fail to match loan processing costs. E.g., for a $15 charge on a $100 14-day payday loan, it could be (from the borrower's perspective) anywhere from 391% to 3733%."
4010,"There are many different ways to calculate annual percentage rate of a loan. Depending on which method is used, the rate calculated may differ dramatically. E.g., for a $15 charge on a $100 14-day payday loan, it could be (from the borrower's perspective) anywhere from 391% to 3733%."
4011,"In most cases, payday loans are much more expensive than other cash loans. For example, a $500 cash advance on an average credit card that is repaid in one month would cost you $13.99 in finance charges and an annual interest rate of about 5.7%. And the finance charge to borrow $100 ranges from $15 to $30 for two week loans. These finance charges are sometimes accompanied by interest rates ranging from 300% to 750% APR. For loans shorter than two weeks, the APR can be even higher."
4012,"Payday loans typically range from approximately $100 to $1000, depending upon your state’s legal minimum. The average loam time is two weeks, after which time you would have to repay the loan along with the fees and interest you accrued over that period. And the finance charge to borrow $100 ranges from $15 to $30 for two week loans. These finance charges are sometimes accompanied by interest rates ranging from 300% to 750% APR. For loans shorter than two weeks, the APR can be even higher."
4013,"Legislation regarding payday loans varies widely between different countries and, within the USA, between different states. To prevent usury (unreasonable and excessive rates of interest), some jurisdictions limit the annual percentage rate (APR) that any lender, including payday lenders, can charge. E.g., for a $15 charge on a $100 14-day payday loan, it could be (from the borrower's perspective) anywhere from 391% to 3733%."
4014,"You can see how with this monthly interest calculator. On any borrowing, the two key things that affect the interest cost are the annual percentage rate of interest (APR) and how long you borrow for. Drag the bar below to set the APR. Payday loans are typically 1000% to 6000% APR. Then hit PLAY to see how the interest would go up if you kept refinancing each month. However beware, the APR is more than the monthly rate times 12. The APR is worked out on the basis that you refinance each month for 12 months. When you take out a new loan to pay off the first one-plus any interest-the next month's interest payment is likely to be significantly MORE."

4024,"Plant your Brussels sprouts about 36 inches apart in nitrogen rich soil. Growing Brussels sprouts need plenty of nutrients and water. Never let your Brussels sprout bed become too dry as this will stress the plants and result in a poor harvest. Water is vital to a good crop. Because Brussels sprouts take so long to mature, your best bet is to plant them in midsummer summer so that they reach full maturity in the cool fall months. Plan to put them in your garden about 3 months before the first frost for your area."
4025,"Brussels sprouts, is a hardy, slow-growing, long-season vegetable belonging to the cabbage family. In the proper season of the year, it can be grown with fair success in most areas of the country. In mild areas, or where there is deep snow cover, the sprouts may overwinter. Like cabbage and cabbage sprouts, Brussels sprouts are a cool weather crop. They should be harvested when the sprouts are small, compact and bright green. Avoid yellowing sprouts with signs of wilt rot or insect damage. Harvest sprouts when they are no larger than 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter."
4026,"Brussels sprouts are slow-growing vegetables that do best in cool weather. Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera) are named for the Belgian city they have grown around for 400 years. This member of the cabbage family and close relative of broccoli, cauliflower and kale grows best in cool, humid climates. The sprout should be about 1 to 2 inches in diameter with tight green leaves. Brussels sprouts leaves should not be yellow. Harvest from the bottom of the plant upward. Sprouts left on the plant will continue to grow and mature. Brussels sprout plants tolerate frost well, but growth will slow in colder temperatur"
4027,"When the brussels sprout plants are about 2.5cm(1) tall, thin the seedlings to about 7.5cm(3) apart in the rows. This is to stop overcrowding thus causing the seedlings to become weak and spindly. The seedlings are ready to plant out when they are about 10cm(4) to 15cm(6) tall. Water the bed the previous day before removing them to their permanent position. When your learning how to grow brussel sprouts there is no need to remember which varietiesto grow: early or late etc. If you're just starting to learn how to grow brussel sprouts and you want to be a bit geeky, these leaves are called cotyledons or 'seed leaves'. Firm the soil around each plant with your hands or the dibber."
4028,"Height. A dwarf plant, brussel sprouts grow off of a central stalk with the sprouts growing at the leaf and stem axis. When properly spaced, a brussel sprout plant will grow to 2 1/2 feet tall when fully mature. Give 24 to 36 inches of space between plants when growing in rows, or 24 inches in any direction when planting in a bed. Transplanting stunted brussel sprout seedlings may lead to plants that never fully mature. You can harvest individual sprouts, the small leaves of the plant, as well as the full stalk. A stalk full of mature brussel sprouts (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera) looks a bit like miniature cabbages."
4029,"Brussels sprouts are a cole crop and like many vegetables in that group, they grow better in cool temperatures.

4030,"Early Growth. Brussels sprout plants will reach heights and spreads of 2 to 3 feet at maturity, so proper care during their early development is essential for healthy growth. When plants are 4 to 5 inches tall, thin the seedlings by pulling up all but the healthiest young plants; allow 14 to 24 inches between stems. The sprout should be about 1 to 2 inches in diameter with tight green leaves. Brussels sprouts leaves should not be yellow. Harvest from the bottom of the plant upward. Sprouts left on the plant will continue to grow and mature. Brussels sprout plants tolerate frost well, but growth will slow in colder temperature"

4032,"This stimulates renin release by the kidney, which increases circulating angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone. These hormones increase blood volume by enhancing renal reabsorption of sodium and water. Increased AII also causes systemic vasoconstriction and enhances sympathetic activity. Increased secretion of aldosterone generally results from adrenal adenoma or adrenal hyperplasia. Increased circulating aldosterone causes renal retention of sodium and water (see figure), so blood volume and arterial pressure increase."
4033,"We tested the hypothesis that aldosterone stimulates angiotensin AT 1 receptor, and causes vasoconstriction by increasing oxidative stress in coronary microcirculation. Coronary arterioles (60–120 μm) were isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and control Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, aged 23–26 weeks. Being consistent with the finding of angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction in resistance arterioles, aldosterone-induced vasoconstriction is dependent on scavengers and inactivation of nitric oxide by superoxide anions generated after stimulation of angiotensin AT 1 receptor."
4034,"No. Although it is produced via the renin, angiotensin, aldosterone pathway, where angiotensin is a powerful vasoconstrictor, aldosterone itself has no vasoconstrictive properties. The sympathetic nervous system causes both vasoconstriction & vasodilation. During fight or flight you need more O2/blood delivered to your skeletal muscles. The SNS ca … uses vasodilation in skeletal muscles. The other organs, of the body (like digestive organs) are not needed for fight or flight survival."
4035,"Renal disease may also result in increased release of renin leading to a renin-dependent form of hypertension. The elevation in arterial pressure secondary to renal disease can be viewed as an attempt by the kidney to increase renal perfusion and restore glomerular filtration. Increased secretion of aldosterone generally results from adrenal adenoma or adrenal hyperplasia. Increased circulating aldosterone causes renal retention of sodium and water (see figure), so blood volume and arterial pressure increase."
4036,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Vasoconstriction is the narrowing of the blood vessels resulting from contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels, in particular the large arteries and small arterioles. The process is the opposite of vasodilation, the widening of blood vessels. Generalized vasoconstriction usually results in an increase in systemic blood pressure, but it may also occur in specific tissues, causing a localized reduction in blood flow. The extent of vasoconstriction may be slight or severe depending on the substance or circumstance"
4037,"Whenever blood flow to the kidney diminishes, renin is secreted and angiotensin is formed. The angiotensin causes widespread vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure consequent to greatly increased total peripheral resistance. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system see renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. respiratory system the group of specialized organs whose specific function is to provide for the transfer of oxygen from the air to the blood and of waste carbon dioxide from the blood to the air."

4083,"A virus is a tiny organism that causes an infection in the body. Viruses are made up of the genetic material known as DNA or RNA, which the virus uses to replicate. In order for a virus to survive, it must invade and attach itself to a living cell."
4084,"When it comes into contact with a host cell, a virus can insert its genetic material into its host, literally taking over the host's functions. An infected cell produces more viral protein and genetic material instead of its usual products."
4085,"In general, each type of virus tends to infect only a certain type of cell in the body. (For example, the viruses that cause the common cold only infect the cells lining the nose and throat.). Several viruses are linked with cancer in humans."
4086,"Viruses depend on the host cells that they infect to reproduce. When found outside of host cells, viruses exist as a protein coat or capsid, sometimes enclosed within a membrane. The capsid encloses either DNA or RNA which codes for the virus elements."
4087,"This is how viruses cause disease. Generally, viruses will only infect one type of cell. For example, the cold virus will only infect cells of the upper respiratory tract. Viruses can be transmitted in numerous ways, such as through contact with an infected person, swallowing, inhalation, or unsafe sex."

In people with a genetic predisposition, the risk of disease can depend on multiple factors in addition to an identified genetic change. For example, some mutations alter a gene’s DNA sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. Often, gene mutations that could cause a genetic disorder are repaired by certain enzymes before the gene is expressed and an altered protein is produced."

These changes occur in genes that are essential for development, and often disrupt the development of an embryo in its earliest stages. For example, some mutations alter a gene’s DNA sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. Often, gene mutations that could cause a genetic disorder are repaired by certain enzymes before the gene is expressed and an altered protein is produced."
4140,"Genetic predisposition testing looks at a person s likelihood to develop a specific condition, based on specific genetic markers or mutations. These tests are helpful if you are worried that you may develop a specific condition and you would like to make environmental adjustments to lower your risk. A genetic predisposition can give you the average lifetime likelihood that you ll develop a disease, but whether you develop a disease is largely dependent on external factors such as diet and lifestyle, for example."

However, despite ambitious efforts, there is substantial evidence that chronic diseases are not caused by human genes. Failed promise of human genetic research. We know that diseases cluster in families. In some diseases, the risk might be two or three times higher than normal, or 30 times higher, for a relative of someone with a disease. But when we do these genomic studies, we find maybe a 50 percent increase in risk."
4143,"1 Diagnostic testing can be performed at any time during a person's life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. 2  The results of a diagnostic test can influence a person's choices about health care and the management of the disease. 1 If both parents are tested, the test can provide information about a couple's risk of having a child with a genetic condition like cystic fibrosis. 2  Preimplantation genetic diagnosis: Genetic testing procedures that are performed on human embryos prior to the implantation as part of an in vitro fertilization procedure."
4144,"Changes in many genes, each with a small effect, may underlie susceptibility to many common diseases, including cancer, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and mental illness. In people with a genetic predisposition, the risk of disease can depend on multiple factors in addition to an identified genetic change.

4154,"At this time, it is not known what causes plaque psoriasis. What experts do know is there's a link between the immune system, genetics and plaque psoriasis. The majority of researchers conclude that with plaque psoriasis, the immune system is triggered in error. "
4155,"Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes scaly pink patches. Guttate psoriasis is a particular form of the disease that usually affects children and young adults. It can happen on its own, or as a complication of ordinary (chronic plaque) psoriasis. Often, it follows a bacterial throat infection or tonsillitis. About Psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic (long-lasting) skin disease of scaling and inflammation that affects greater than 3 percent of the U.S. population, or more than 5 million adults."
4156,"The cause of psoriasis isn't fully known, but it's thought to be related to an immune system problem with cells in your body. More specifically, one key cell is a type of white blood cell called a T lymphocyte or T cell. Psoriasis typically starts or worsens because of a trigger that you may be able to identify and avoid. Factors that may trigger psoriasis include: 1  Infections, such as strep throat or skin infections. 2  Injury to the skin, such as a cut or scrape, bug bite, or a severe sunburn."
4157,"Plaque psoriasis is a chronic immune disease. While the exact cause is unknown, psoriasis occurs when the immune system sends out faulty signals that speed up the growth cycle of skin cells. While normal skin cells mature and fall off the body within about a month, skin cells in psoriatic plaques mature rapidly and take only 3-4 days to surface. "
4158,"But in conditions like plaque psoriasis, your immune system is not working properly. It can make too much of several proteins, including one called tumor necrosis factor, or TNF. The extra TNF can contribute to skin cells growing too quickly, and causes them to build up. Plaque psoriasis is a lifelong condition that causes dry, thick, scaly, red skin. About 7.5 million adults in America have psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form."
4159,"Unpredictable and irritating, psoriasis is one of the most baffling and persistent of skin disorders. It's characterized by skin cells that multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. As underlying cells reach the skin's surface and die, their sheer volume causes raised, red plaques covered with white scales. The symptoms of psoriasis vary depending on the type you have. Some common symptoms for plaque psoriasis -- the most common variety of the condition -- include: 1  Plaques of red skin, often covered with loose, silver-colored scales; these lesions may be itchy and painful, and they sometimes crack and bleed"
4160,"Plaque Psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of the disease and appears as raised, red patches covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells. These patches or plaques most often show up on the scalp, knees, elbows and lower back. They are often itchy and painful, and they can crack and bleed. While scientists do not know what exactly causes psoriasis, we do know that the immune system and genetics play major roles in its development. Usually, something triggers psoriasis to flare. The skin cells in people with psoriasis grow at an abnormally fast rate, which causes the buildup of psoriasis lesions."
4161,"Plaque Psoriasis Diagnosis. Usually dermatologists and most primary-care professionals are able to diagnose classical psoriasis on the basis of the appearance of the individual lesions, the tendency to form plaques, and the distribution of those plaques on the elbows, knees, and scalp. "

ANIMALS HAVING BACK BONE OR VERTEBRAL COLUMN R CALLED VERTEBRATES Vertebrates or chordates are classified into 7 classes, which are bony fish, cartilage fish, jawless fish, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. The way animals are classified as vertebrate or invertebrate, is on, simply, if they have a spine or not! Animals who don't have spines, are invertebrate, and ones that do are … vertebrate."
4197,"The vertebral column is composed of a series of 31 separate bones known as vertebrae. There are seven cervical or neck vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, and five lumbar vertebrae. The sacrum is composed of five fused vertebrae, and there are two coccygeal vertebrae which are sometimes fused (fig. 1). In the normal adult there are four curvatures in the vertebral column in an anteroposterior plane. These serve to align the head with a vertical line through the pelvis (fig. 2)."
4198,"The centra of the vertebra can be classified based on the fusion of its elements. In aspidospondyly, bones such as the spinous process, the pleurocentrum and the intercentrum are separate ossifications. Fused elements, however, classify a vertebra as having holospondyly. When multiple sacral vertebrae are fused into a single structure, it is called the sacrum.

4214,"The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most well known species of marine mammals. They have a robust body and a short, thick beak. Their coloration ranges from light gray to black with lighter coloration on the belly. Inshore and offshore individuals vary in color and size. Adults weight from 300-1400 lbs (136-635 kg). This is a long-lived dolphin species with a lifespan of 40-45 years for males and more than 50 years for females. Bottlenose dolphins are commonly found in groups of 2 to 15 individuals. Offshore herds sometimes have several hundred"
4215,"Like the name “bottlenose” suggests, this species of dolphin has a short, stubby beak. Its sleek, conical body varies in color from a light to slate grey on the upper body to a pale to pinkish grey on the bottom part. Bottlenose dolphins measure around 2-4 m (6-12 ft.) long and weigh 135-650 kg (300 – 1400 lbs.). Males are significantly larger than females."
4216,"The common bottlenose dolphin is grey in color and may be between 2 and 4 m (6.6 and 13.1 ft) long, and weighs between 150 and 650 kg (330 and 1,430 lb). Males are generally larger and heavier than females. Common bottlenose dolphins are the most familiar dolphins due to the wide exposure they receive in captivity in marine parks and dolphinaria, and in movies and television programs. T. truncatus is the largest species of the beaked dolphins."
4217,"There are two species of bottlenose dolphins, the common bottlenose dolphin (scientific name: Tursiops truncatus) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (scientific name: Tursiops aduncus). Bottlenose dolphins have great flexibility because they have fewer fused vertebrae in their necks than other dolphins. Color: The bottlenose dolphin is generally a dark gray on the upper part of its body, fading into a lighter gray on both sides of its body. The belly color can range from white to light pinkish color."
4218,"For the genus of dolphin, see Bottlenose dolphin. Tursiops truncatus, commonly known as the common bottlenose dolphin or the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (and in older literature simply as the bottlenose dolphin, a term now applied to the genus), is the most well-known species from the family Delphinidae. Common bottlenose dolphins are the most familiar dolphins due to the wide exposure they receive in captivity in marine parks and dolphinaria, and in movies and television programs. T. truncatus is the largest species of the beaked dolphins."
4219,"These species are the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) and the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis), the last which only came to light as a species in autumn 2011. The bottlenose part of their name is a tribute to their stumpy beaks. Burrunan dolphins are a new concept in the bottlenose dolphin world, although the notion of different types of dolphins in some Australian waters existed previously. They, like common bottlenose and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, have several different colors on their bodies."
4220,"The color for a Bottlenose Dolphin can range from light to dark shades of gray. They seem to have lighter colors on the flanks. The belly is usually white but it can have a pinkish tint to it. Just like land animals with forelimbs, these dolphins feature pectoral flippers with a similar skeletal make up. A group of Bottlenose Dolphins is called a pod, and they are very social with each other. There can be from 10 to 100 members in a pod. When there are larger numbers, there are also various subgroups within it that allow them to carry out their overall hierarchy."
4221,"1 The common bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus) is found in most tropical to temperate oceans; its color is grey, with the shade of grey varying among populations; it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin. Recent molecular studies show the genus contains two species, the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), instead of one. Research in 2011 revealed a third species, the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis)"

4229,The current clinical classification system for tuberculosis (TB) is based on the pathogenesis of the disease. Health care providers should comply with local laws and regulations requiring the reporting of TB. All persons with class 3 or class 5 TB should be reported promptly to the local health department. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has an additional TB classification for immigrants and refugees developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The B notification program is an important screening strategy to identify new arrivals who have a high risk for TB.
4230,"People with TB disease have symptoms or other manifestations of illness such as an abnormal chest radiograph. In the remainder, the infection remains in a latent state (latent TB infection or LTBI) in which the infected person has no symptoms and cannot spread TB to others. "
4231,"In their active state, TB bacteria cause death of tissue in the organs they infect. Active TB disease can be fatal if left untreated. Because the bacteria that cause tuberculosis are transmitted through the air, the disease can be contagious. Infection is most likely to occur if you are exposed to someone with TB on a day-to-day basis, such as by living or working in close quarters with someone who has the active disease. The remaining will have what's called latent TB infection -- they show no signs of infection and won't be able to spread the disease to others, unless their disease becomes active. Because these latent infections can eventually become active, even people without symptoms should receive medical treatment."
4232,"TB is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB disease should be suspected in persons who have the following symptoms: 1  Unexplained weight loss. 2  Loss of appetite. 3  Night sweats. 4  Fever. 5  Fatigue. Clinicians should ask about the patient’s history of TB exposure, infection, or disease. It is also important to consider demographic factors (e.g., country of origin, age, ethnic or racial group, occupation) that may increase the patient’s risk for exposure to TB or to drug-resistant TB."
4233,"The typical symptoms of TB disease are prolonged cough, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, fever, and chest pain. When in contact with a patient known or suspected to have active TB disease, place a surgical mask on the patient, if possible, and wear an N95 respirator (or PAPR or SCBA), if one is available. If a respirator is not available, use a surgical mask for yourself. Tuberculosis (TB) is a treatable infectious disease that usually affects the lungs and airway, but may also affect other parts of the body. People with TB disease in other parts of the body are not infectious to others."
4234,"Tuberculosis, commonly known as TB, is a contagious and an often severe airborne disease caused by a bacterial infection. TB typically affects the lungs, but it also may affect any other organ of the body. It is usually treated with a regimen of drugs taken for 6 months to 2 years, depending on the type of infection. "
4235,"What is Tuberculosis? Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of humans and animals. The most common cause of human disease is the bacteria (mycobacteria) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). In 1995, almost 23,000 human cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "

4238,"The Himalayas belong to the youngest mountain ranges in the world. They were formed when the Indian subcontinent, which was originally a part of the southern landmass, drifted to the north and crashed into Asia. This movement started about 70 million years ago and has been going on up to the present day. The Himalayas are still becoming taller, moving at about 7 cm per year. The Himalayas are mountains that are located in southern Asia. They are a part of in Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Bhutan. The mountains are the highest in the world, reaching almost 9,000 meters above sea level."

The Himalayas, which stretch some 2,900 kilometres between India, Pakistan, China, and Nepal, is the world’s tallest mountain range. In addition to Mount Everest, the world’s tallest mountain by peak elevation standing at 8,848 meters tall, the range also features several other mountain peaks over 8,000 meters. In part, the rate of vertical growth has varied over time, including in favor of more horizontal growth. And, of course, gravity and erosion having limited the mountains’ growth significantly. India merging into Asia became the accepted theory about how the Himalayas were formed around 1912."

4343,"Acetylcholine is also used as a neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system, both as an internal transmitter for the sympathetic nervous system and as the final product released by the parasympathetic nervous system. Acetylcholine has functions both in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and in the central nervous system (CNS) as a neuromodulator. In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine activates muscles, and is a major neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system."
4344,"Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is released in the synaptic cleft and goes over the sarcolemma down the tubule and promotes the release of calcium from the sarcoreticulum which then binds to proteins on actin which exposes binding spots for myosin to attach to and powerstroke causing muscle contraction. The result of this binding of acetylcholine to the acetylcholine receptor is opening of sodium channels and influx of sodium cations into the muscle cell, causing the resting potential of that muscle cell to begin to depolarize."
4345,"In summary, excite the muscle cell. In a little more detailed summary, acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that reversibly binds to and stimulates the muscarinic acetylcholi … ne receptors on the post-synaptic region of the sarcolemma of the skeletal muscle, called the motor end plate.

4349,"Inside the brain acetylcholine functions as a neuromodulator —a chemical that alters the way other brain structures process information rather than a chemical used to transmit information from point to point. The brain contains a number of cholinergic areas, each with distinct functions. Acetylcholine has functions both in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and in the central nervous system (CNS) as a neuromodulator. In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine activates muscles, and is a major neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system."
4350,"Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that allows communication between cells in your brain. Acetylcholine is also the neurotransmitter that controls the contraction of skeletal muscle, the muscle the moves your body as opposed to the muscles of your heart and digestive system. Acetylcholine is produced from the essential nutrient choline that you must obtain in your diet. Eat foods rich in choline to maintain a healthy level of acetylcholine in your body."
4351,"Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction —in other words, it is the chemical that motor neurons of the nervous system release in order to activate muscles. This property means that drugs that affect cholinergic systems can have very dangerous effects ranging from paralysis to convulsions.

You can shoot at a pool of water, but the water just re-forms around the bullet, allowing it to pass through without resistance."
4362,"Becoming self-sufficient is only one of the means by which we can become invulnerable. A second way is conformism, whereby we adjust our desire scheme in such a way that we want what is going to happen anyway. We conform our will to what will happen; we take the attitude, whatever happens is what I want. If we have restricted ourselves to desires about the evident, it will not matter how many beliefs we have about the nonevident. They will not bother us. Keeping them or abandoning them, and being right or wrong about them, will be a matter of indifference."

ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS. Matthew Kelly writes: Life is the spending and replenishing of energy ..

If we have restricted ourselves to desires about the evident, it will not matter how many beliefs we have about the nonevident. They will not bother us.

[Stoics] held it to be not in keeping with the prerogative of reason that a being endowed with it. . .should yet be exposed to such intense pain, such great anxiety and suffering, as arise from the tempestuous strain of desiring and shunning. . . . It was thought that the proper application of reason was bound to raise man above them, and enable him to become invulnerable.

4427,"Criteria for essentiality for human health are that withdrawal or absence of the metal from the diet produces either functional or structural abnormalities, and that the abnormalities are related to, or are a consequence of, specific biochemical changes that can be reversed by the presence of the essential metal."
4428,"Do that with each of the different metals you have. Your body and the environment have a definite effect on the metal. Likewise, when the metal touches you, your body has a reaction to the metal as well. So, in conclusion, many of the ways of the past have been lost but not forgotten."

4430,"Nutrients are substances needed for growth, metabolism, and for other body functions. Macronutrients are nutrients that provide calories or energy. The prefix makro is from the Greek and means big or large, used because macronutrients are required in large amounts. There are three broad classes of macro-nutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Carbohydrates are roughly 50% oxygen, and like fats, they usually have less than 5% nitrogen or none at all. Proteins, on the other hand, consist of 15-25% nitrogen and about an equal amount of oxygen. The three macronutrients are often found together in most foods, but in varying amounts, or alone in other foods."
4431,"Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins are one of the macronutrients. Though protein provides your body with 4 kcals per gram, giving you energy is not its primary role. Rather, it’s got way too many other things going on. In fact, your body contains thousands of different proteins, each with a unique function. A complete protein includes all of the essential amino acids. Complete proteins include all animal proteins and soy. Incomplete proteins lack one or more essential amino acids. Beans, nuts, grains and vegetables are incomplete proteins."
4432,"This framework consists of two types of nutrients: macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrates), which supply energy in the form of calories, and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), which support the various biochemical processes in your body. Keeping track of macronutrients is fairly simple – there are only three, and most people have a rough idea of what kinds of foods supply which ones. But tracking every single micronutrient in your diet to make sure you meet your RDA would be impossibly tedious. Luckily, you don’t have to."

The Major Macronutrients The 4 Macronutrients Sometimes it is confusing trying to figure out how carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fiber, calories and all of the other nutritional components fit into an overall eating plan or diet. Coincidentally, there are four macronutrients that reside in every cell in the human body: Carbohydrates, which come primarily from plants, e.g. land vegetables, fruits, grains, sea vegetables, other plant foods; and, from man-made processed foods, e.g. bread (flour), pasta, cereal."

4501,"The pyruvic molecules formed in glycolosis enter the mitochondria, where they are converted to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). In this complex series of reactions, pyruvate undergoes oxidative decarboxylation. At this point in aerobic respiration, four NADH molecules have been formed from a single starting glucose molecule, two during glycolosis and two during the formation of acetyl CoA from pyruvate. STEP 3: Citric Acid Cycle."
4502,"All genomes sequenced to date encode enzymes that use coenzyme A as a substrate, and around 4% of cellular enzymes use it (or a thioester, such as acetyl-CoA) as a substrate. In humans, CoA biosynthesis requires cysteine, pantothenate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Coenzyme A is also the source of the phosphopantetheine group that is added as a prosthetic group to proteins such as acyl carrier protein and formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase."
4503,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Acetyl coenzyme A or acetyl-CoA is an important molecule in metabolism, used in many biochemical reactions. Its main function is to convey the carbon atoms within the acetyl group to the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) to be oxidized for energy production. Structure of coenzyme A (CoASH or CoA) consists of a β-mercaptoethylamine group linked to the vitamin pantothenic acid through an amide linkage. The acetyl group of acetyl-CoA is linked by a high energy thioester to the sulfhydryl portion of the β-mercaptoethylamine"
4504,"Coenzyme A reacts with acyl groups, giving rise to thioester derivatives, such as acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA. Coenzyme A and its acyl derivatives are required for reactions that generate energy from the degradation of dietary fat, carbohydrates, and proteins. Coenzyme A. Pantothenic acid is a precursor in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) (Figure 1), an essential coenzyme in a variety of biochemical reactions that sustain life (see below). Pantothenic acid kinase II (PANKII) catalyzes the initial step of phosphorylation of pantothenic acid to 4’-phosphopantothenic acid."
4505,"The pyruvic molecules formed in glycolosis enter the mitochondria, where they are converted to acetyl Coenzyme-A (acetyl-CoA). In this complex series of reactions, pyruvate undergoes oxidative decarboxylation. The hydrogens removed have reduced NAD+ to NADH. At this point in aerobic respiration, four NADH molecules have been formed from a single starting glucose molecule, two during glycolosis and two during the formation of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate."
4506,"In addition, coenzyme A in the form of acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is involved in the citric acid cycle, in the synthesis of essential fats, cholesterol, steroid hormones, vitamins A and D, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and in the fatty acid β- oxidation pathway. Coenzyme A. Pantothenic acid is a precursor in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) (Figure 1), an essential coenzyme in a variety of biochemical reactions that sustain life (see below). Pantothenic acid kinase II (PANKII) catalyzes the initial step of phosphorylation of pantothenic acid to 4’-phosphopantothenic acid."
4507,"Since coenzyme A is, in chemical terms, a thiol, it can react with carboxylic acids to form thioesters, thus functioning as an acyl group carrier. It assists in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. A molecule of coenzyme A carrying an acetyl group is also referred to as acetyl-CoA. Coenzyme A is also the source of the phosphopantetheine group that is added as a prosthetic group to proteins such as acyl carrier protein and formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase."

It may also exist as soil deposited at the bottom of a water body. silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm or 3.9 and 62.5 micons. Mud is a mixture of water and some combination of soil, silt, and clay. Ancient mud deposits harden over geological time to form sedimentary rock such as shale or mudstone (generally called lutites). When geological deposits of mud are formed in estuaries the resultant layers are termed bay mud"
4509,"The sand, silt, and clay that results from rock weathering form the basic components of soil. If the material stays where it formed-above or otherwise in contact with the unweathered parent rock-the soil is called a residual soil. Mechanical weathering does the same thing to all rocks: breaks them down into small pieces, which eventually become the size of sand, silt, and clay. Sand, silt, and clay are primarily measures of grain size. Sand grains have a diameter from 1/16th to 2 mm. Silt is between 1/256th and 1/16th mm, and clay is anything less than 1/256th mm. Sand looks like individual grains and feels gritty to the fingers"
4510,"Silt refers to a grain size of the particle, not its composition. Sand is the same. While … sand is normally Silicon Dioxide (quartz) it could be made up of any mineral. Clay, silt, sand, pebble, boulder are examples of grain size in increasing size. "
4511,"Silt is granular material of a size somewhere between sand and clay whose mineral origin is quartz (made up of a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall formula SiO2) and feldspar (KAlSi3O8 – NaAlSi3O8 – CaAl2Si2O8). Mud is a mixture of water and some combination of soil, silt, and clay. Ancient mud deposits harden over geological time to form sedimentary rock such as shale or mudstone (generally called lutites).

Silt may occur as a soil or as sediment mixed in suspension with water (also known as a suspended load) in a body of water such as a river. It may also exist as soil deposited at the bottom of a water body. Silt has a moderate specific area with a typically non-sticky, plastic feel"
4513,"The term loam refers to a soil with a combination of sand, silt, and clay sized particles. For example, a soil with 30% clay, 50% sand, and 20% silt is called a sandy clay loam. [Figure 2]. Figure 3. Soil Textural Triangle-Based on the triangle, a loamy soil has 40% sand, 20% clay and4-% silt. The terms sand, silt, and clay refer to relative sizes of the soil particles. Sand, being the larger size of particles, feels gritty. Silt, being moderate in size, has a smooth or floury texture. Clay, being the smaller size of particles, feels sticky."
4514,Siltstone. Siltstone is made from silt of course. Silt is another name for clay and is very fine grained. The grain size is from 1/16 to 1/256 of a millimeter in diameter. It is very similar to sandstone in appearance but with a finer texture. Once deposited the silt becomes compacted and cemented together into solid stone.
4515,"Sand particles are the biggest, then silt and finally clay. Water: clings to soil particles; is taken up by plant roots.Air: fills gaps in soil; allows the plant roots and animals to breathe . Just under half, about 35 to 40%, of a good soil is made up of water and air! "
4516,"Nucleic acids are biopolymers, or large biomolecules, essential for all known forms of life. Nucleic acids, which include DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), are made from monomers known as nucleotides. Each nucleotide has three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. If the sugar is deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA. If the sugar is ribose, the polymer is RNA. When sugar and a nitrogenous base get combined they form a nucleotide. Nucleotides are also known as phosphate nucleotides."

The nitrogenous bases form the rungs of the ladder and are connected through hydrogen bonds. The phosphate is the same in DNA and RNA, but the sugar can be a ribose (for RNA) or a deoxyribose (for DNA). The latter is a ribose without  de-  one oxygen  -oxy- . There are four available nitrogenous bases in a DNA's nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosin"

DNA is found in the chromosomes of the nucleus in a cell and it carries hereditary information. RNA is located in the cell but not in the nucleus. Just as proteins consist of long chains of amino acids, DNA and RNA consists of nucleic acid chains called nucleotides. Nucleotides are composed of three units: base, sugar (monosaccharide) and phosphate. Bases are found in both DNA and RNA. As seen below, they are adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. They are abbreviated (A, C, G, T, U)."
4521,"Perennials can be divided into two categories. Deciduous perennials, such as the perennial flowers mentioned above, grow part of the year and fall dormant the rest of the year. Evergreen perennials, such as pine trees, grow year round. Some people have a hard time remembering the proper term for each type of plant. That’s because some of them are annual plants and some are perennial plants. Annual plants are plants with a life cycle that lasts only one year. They grow from seed, bloom, produce seeds and die in one growing season. They then need to be replanted each spring."
4522,"Perennial Seeds and Plants. something to look forward to... Year after year, Burpee's perennial seeds and plants will fill your home garden beds and borders. Select from our full palette of colors, textures, forms and fragrances to create the perennial garden of your dreams-a sensory pleasure for years to come. "
4523,"Perennials, or plants and flowers that come back year after year, are found in virtually every yard. Perennial flowers work in multiple situations: in whole garden beds, in combination with annuals and bulbs, as accent to shrubs and trees, and in containers and windowboxes. Perennial. Asters get their name from the Latin word for star, and their flowers are indeed the superstars of the fall garden. Some types of this native plant can reach up to 6 feet with flowers in white and pinks but also, perhaps most strikingly, in rich purples and showy lavenders."
4524,"Perennial plants can be short-lived (only a few years) or they can be long-lived, as are some woody plants like trees. They include a wide assortment of plant groups from ferns and liverworts to the highly diverse flowering plants like orchids and grasses. The symbol for a perennial plant, based on Species Plantarum by Linnaeus, is, which is also the astronomical symbol for the planet Jupiter."
4525,"Not all plants with the ability to be perennial are hardy in all areas. Some can be killed by freezing temperatures, excessively dry conditions or other growing conditions. This is why hardiness zones are so important. Knowing what zone you garden in will allow you to determine what plants will survive in your area. The term perennial is most often used for plants with showy flowers, but plants like ornamental grasses, tropicals and other plants that have their own categories may also be perennial. "
4526,"The term  perennial  refers to herbaceous (“green”) plants since woody plants, such as trees, are perennial by definition. Unlike annuals, perennials tend to bloom for just a short time — one to three weeks — each year. Examples of popular perennial flowers include tulips, asters, black-eyed susans and lilies. That’s because some of them are annual plants and some are perennial plants. Annual plants are plants with a life cycle that lasts only one year. They grow from seed, bloom, produce seeds and die in one growing season. They then need to be replanted each spring."
4527,"Definition of Perennial Plants. Simply put, unlike annuals or biennials, perennials are plants that live year after year. Some perennials, such as trees and shrubs, have significant life spans. Others, like many flowering perennials, may need to be replaced every three or more years. If you are ruminating on what to plant in your garden, re-landscaping or adding to the home landscape, you may be considering any number of perennial garden plants."
4528,"A perennial plant or simply perennial is a plant that lives for more than two years. The term is often used to differentiate a plant from shorter-lived annuals and biennials. The term is also widely used to distinguish plants with little or no woody growth from trees and shrubs, which are also technically perennials. The symbol for a perennial plant, based on Species Plantarum by Linnaeus, is, which is also the astronomical symbol for the planet Jupiter."
4529,"Perennials are the plants that keep on giving. When properly planted and taken care of, these plants and flowers can be counted on to come back in bloom year after year saving you time, energy and money. "
4530,"See the article on phases of the Moon for further details. A lunation or synodic month is the mean (average) time from one new moon to the next. In the J2000.0 epoch, the average length of a lunation is 29.530588 days (or 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 3 seconds). For all new moons between 1601 and 2401, the maximum difference is 0.592 days = 14h13m in either direction. The duration of a lunation (i.e. the time from new moon to the next new moon) varies in this period between 29.272 and 29.833 days, i.e. −0.259d = 6h12m shorter, or +0.302d = 7h15m longer than average."

Progressed First and Last Quarters. Such phases of the progressed lunation cycle usually correspond to periods of great emotional or mental tension. At first quarter the confrontations, as a rule, affect the basic instinctual impulses and emotions of the person."
4532,"The Lunation Number or Lunation Cycle is a number given to each lunation beginning from a certain one in history. Several conventions are in use. For all new moons between 1601 and 2401, the maximum difference is 0.592 days = 14h13m in either direction. The duration of a lunation (i.e. the time from new moon to the next new moon) varies in this period between 29.272 and 29.833 days, i.e. −0.259d = 6h12m shorter, or +0.302d = 7h15m longer than average."
4533,"The term  moon cycle  (or lunar cycle) refers to the moon's continuous orbit around the earth. As the moon orbits the earth, its appearance (the phase) changes and thus gives us an indication of the moon's progress in the cycle (the age). This complete lunar cycle (New Moon to New Moon) is also called a lunation. During this time the moon will completely circle the earth. That's the scientific definition, but you can take any phase; for instance a so-called full moon cycle would be from Full Moon to Full Moon"

Such phases of the progressed lunation cycle usually correspond to periods of great emotional or mental tension. At first quarter the confrontations, as a rule, affect the basic instinctual impulses and emotions of the person."
4535,"The lunation cycle refers to the period from one New Moon to the next — a New Moon being a conjunction of the Moon with the Sun. It lasts between 29 and 30 days. Any birth occurs within a lunation cycle, either when the light of the Moon is increasing or when it is decreasing. "
4536,"(*)Note that the computed lunation of 29 26/49 days is a bit too long, so an adjustment of 1/49 day must be made periodically to compensate. An adjustment every 850 lunations brings the value pretty close. In this case, there has been one such adjustment between the epoch and the January 2000 new moon. There are 13.944335 synodic months in a full moon cycle, the 251-month cycle approximates the full moon cycle to 13.944444 synodic months and the 767-month cycle approximates the full moon cycle to 13.9454545 synodic months."
4537,"It has long been thought that the period of the lunation cycle is associated with the menstrual cycle of mature human females. A 1979 study of 305 women found that approximately one-third of the subjects had lunar period cycles, i.e., a mean cycle length of 29.5 days plus or minus 1 day. In a lunar calendar each month corresponds to a lunation. Individual lunations vary in length by several hours, because of the eccentricity of the orbits of the Moon and Earth. However, the lunation is never more than 15 hours behind or ahead of a mean lunation."
4538,"Scientific research into the lunation cycle over the last 15-20 years is fascinating from an astrologer's perspective. It was not very—many years ago that—science gave little or no credence to the possibility of a lunar effect on life here on earth. Rainfall -- It has been well documented that rainfall is correlated with the Moon's position in its monthly cycle. According to many studies, rainfall maximizes midway through the 1st and 3rd quarters of the lunar synodic month. In other words, about a half week after new and full moon rainfall reaches a peak."

4848,"The unique smell and flavor of a cannabis strain is produced in part by its flavonoids, the aromatic molecules. Some flavonoids, like quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol, naturally appear in many different plants. But flavonoids that are unique to cannabis are called cannaflavins, and they don’t just smell good, they are pharmacologically active. Each strain has its own aroma and effect. This unique signature is not only the result of cannabinoids, but also due to lesser known molecules: The flavonoids, terpenes, terpenoids."
4849,"A final thought on the intelligent use of phytocannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids with your pets: these compounds are not a cure-all wonder drug. They are to be used as directed with any and all currently prescribed medications and therapies, as directed by your attending veterinarian. Out of the currently 23 identified flavonoids in hemp, only a few have ben researched with regards to their physiologic effects. A common flavonoid, not related to hemp but used in medication for years, is rutin. Rutin is a citrus derived flavonoid from the Fava D’Anta tree (Dimorphandra mollis)."

4956,"These are known as macromolecules. Most macromolecules are polymers, which are long chains of subunits called monomers. These subunits are often very similar to each other, and for all the diversity of polymers (and living things in general) there are only about 40 - 50 common monomers. Phospholipids are like fats but they have two fatty acids and a phosphate group joined to glycerol. The fatty acid tails are hydrophobic but the phosphate part is hydrophilic. This is an important feature of these molecules. More about phospholipids when we cover membrane structure."
4957,"Best Answer: It's a nucleic acid, made up of monomers called nucleotides. A nucleotide consists of three parts: a) A sugar-deoxyribose (ribose in RNA) b) An organic base-adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine (in DNA. In RNA, there is uracil instead of thymine) c) A phosphate group I hope that helps. :) ILoveMaths07"
