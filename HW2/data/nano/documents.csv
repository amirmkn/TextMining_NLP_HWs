1,"The first communication from the Boston Committee of Correspondence sent to the towns of Massachusetts was a list of grievances (below) they had with Britain with a request that their views be endorsed. In Boston on Monday, November 2, 1772, they organized a town meeting at Faneuil Hall and garnered enough support to vote in a resolution to create a standing Committee of Correspondence."
2,"The Boston Committee of Correspondence was formed at the Boston Town Meeting of November 2, 1772 in response to the British government’s decision to pay the governor and Superior Court judges of Massachusetts with Crown stipends, thereby making them dependent on the Crown rather than the people in assembly. With the gradual establishment of self-government and the evacuation of the British from Boston in March 1776, the Committee of Correspondence attended to public safety activities in the Boston area until the end of the Revolutionary War."
3,"Circular Letter of the Boston Committee of Correspondence; May 13, 1774. We have just received the copy of an Act of the British Parliament passed in the present session whereby the town of Boston is treated in a manner the most ignominious, cruel, and unjust. "
4,"The Boston Committee of Correspondence records, dated 1772-1784, document the Committee’s initiatives in colonial political action in Massachusetts, from the writing of the Boston Pamphlet in November 1772 through the early months of war with Great Britain in 1775, as well as the Committee's contact with other colonies. With the gradual establishment of self-government and the evacuation of the British from Boston in March 1776, the Committee of Correspondence attended to public safety activities in the Boston area until the end of the Revolutionary War."

6,"In late 1773, the Boston Committee of Correspondence was charged with managing the “tea crisis” and was the driving force of the December 16, 1773 Boston Tea Party…. These Committees of Correspondence were intercolonial standing provincial governments. In late 1773, the Boston Committee of Correspondence was charged with managing the “tea crisis” and was the driving force of the December 16, 1773, Boston Tea Party, which was carried out by the Sons of Liberty."
7,"This report of the Boston Committee of Correspondence was prepared by Sam Adams and read to the Boston Town Meeting on Nov. 20, 1772. The inflammatory piece, written by the known radical and master propagandist, is a window looking into Revolutionary Boston four years before the Declaration of Independence. For example the Committee of Correspondence in Boston gave its blessing on the raiding of the Dartmouth and the destruction of its cargo that became known as the Boston Tea Party. As the revolution drew nearer, the committees became the spine of colonial interaction."
8,"The Boston Committee of Correspondence was the driving force of the December 16, 1773, Boston Tea Party, which was carried out by the Sons of Liberty. Samuel Adams was the prominent leader of both organizations.

9,"Kidney stones may cause cloudy urine. They can cause pus in the urine, which gives your pee that milky or cloudy look. If you have kidney stones, the pain of the stones may lead you to see a doctor more quickly than the cloudy urine. Some possible cloudy urine causes are: Food can cause a change in the consistency and color of your urine, although they are not the usual cause of cloudy urine. Blood in urine-When the blood is microscopic, it may not show bright red or dark red but rather it may appear as cloudy urine."
10,"A urinary tract infection-a UTI can cause cloudy urine. The urinary tract infection may be accompanied with burning or painful urination. A bladder infection (a more specific type of urinary tract infection), also known as Cystitis, may cause cloudy urine. Some possible cloudy urine causes are: Food can cause a change in the consistency and color of your urine, although they are not the usual cause of cloudy urine. Blood in urine-When the blood is microscopic, it may not show bright red or dark red but rather it may appear as cloudy urine."
11,"Normal urine is clear and has a straw-yellow color. When the urine does not have its characteristic clear appearance, it is often referred to as cloudy, turbid, or foamy urine. Cloudy or foamy urine may occur occasionally due to mild dehydration; when it occurs in the absence of symptoms and goes away rapidly, it is usually of little consequence. Certain conditions can cause excess protein or crystalline substances in the urine, causing it to persistently appear cloudy or foamy. Infections anywhere in the urinary tract can cause blood and pus to appear in the urine, giving it a cloudy appearance. Additionally, many of the numerous causes of blood in the urine can yield a cloudy or murky appearance to the urine due to the presence of blood"
12,"Best Answer: Yellow is NOT a normal color, nor is cloudiness normal. If your urine is yellow, you're dehydrated. The normal color should be clear or perhaps the color of lemonade (just a slight hint of yellow that can't be seen easily). This is a serious condition. The medical community either overlooks the signs of dehydration or else ignores them completely."
13,"Healthy urine is clear and light yellow in color. Urine may appear cloudy for a variety of reasons, some of which are not harmful, such as foaming of the urine that occurs temporarily when urinating rapidly."
14,"Cloudy urine can be caused by a variety of conditions, including vaginal discharge, sexually transmitted diseases, dehydration, certain autoimmune disorders, as well as infection, inflammation, or other conditions of the urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra). Urine may appear cloudy for a variety of reasons, some of which are not harmful, such as foaming of the urine that occurs temporarily when urinating rapidly."

16,"If your cloudy urine is caused by a urinary tract infection, or bladder infection, it is usually treated by simple antibiotics and clears up within a couple of weeks. If your cloudy urine is caused by a kidney stone… you’ll usually know it, as the pain can be pretty intense. Some possible cloudy urine causes are: Food can cause a change in the consistency and color of your urine, although they are not the usual cause of cloudy urine. Blood in urine-When the blood is microscopic, it may not show bright red or dark red but rather it may appear as cloudy urine."
17,"There are a variety of cloudy urine causes. If your urine color is cloudy or looks like milky urine, it could be nothing to worry about … or it could be a sign of a serious illness. Keep in mind that cloudy urine is a symptom and not an illness by itself. Some possible cloudy urine causes are: Food can cause a change in the consistency and color of your urine, although they are not the usual cause of cloudy urine. Blood in urine-When the blood is microscopic, it may not show bright red or dark red but rather it may appear as cloudy urine."
18,"Blood tests will show if your ANCA test is positive or negative. If positive, it shows if there are PR3 or MPO, and it also shows the titer level. The titer shows how high the ANCA level in your blood is. The confusing thing is that not all CSS patients are ANCA positive. According to Prof. dr. Loic Guillevin only one third to one half of all CSS patients are ANCA positive-mostly MPO positive, sometimes PR3, sometimes both."
19,"Bottom right-MPO antibodies on formalin-fixed neutrophils (c-ANCA pattern).(FITC conjugate). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) are a group of autoantibodies, mainly of the IgG type, against antigens in the cytoplasm of neutrophil granulocytes (the most common type of white blood cell) and monocytes. "
20,"Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) may be used to: 1  Help detect and diagnose certain forms of autoimmune vasculitis, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg Strauss syndrome). Positive ANCA, PR3, and/or MPO tests help to support a diagnosis of systemic autoimmune vasculitis and to distinguish between different types. However, to confirm a diagnosis, a biopsy of an affected site is often required."
21,"Two types of tests may be used: 1  Most often, ANCA tests are performed using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA). 2  Myeloperoxidase antibodies and proteinase 3 (PR3) antibodies may be individually and specifically tested using an immunoassay method. Positive ANCA, PR3, and/or MPO tests help to support a diagnosis of systemic autoimmune vasculitis and to distinguish between different types. However, to confirm a diagnosis, a biopsy of an affected site is often required."
22,"No, some patients can be ANCA positive and others ANCA negative. Individual patients may be positive at one blood test and negative at another. The physician uses the ANCA test as a guide to treatment, along with other test results and by examination and discussion with the patient. Anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic antibody. In ANCA associated vasculitis the B-cells produce antibodies that are directed against proteins found on the surface of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell)."
23,"In addition, tests that are specific for antibodies to MPO and PR3 may be performed: 1  A positive test for PR3 antibodies and a positive cANCA or pANCA are seen in more than 80% of patients with active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis). Positive ANCA, PR3, and/or MPO tests help to support a diagnosis of systemic autoimmune vasculitis and to distinguish between different types. However, to confirm a diagnosis, a biopsy of an affected site is often required."
24,"Negative ANCA tests results mean it is unlikely that a person's symptoms are due to an autoimmune vasculitis. For a positive result on the indirect immunofluorescence microscopy method, several different ANCA patterns may be seen: 1  Perinuclear (pANCA) – most of the fluorescence occurs near the nucleus. Positive ANCA, PR3, and/or MPO tests help to support a diagnosis of systemic autoimmune vasculitis and to distinguish between different types. However, to confirm a diagnosis, a biopsy of an affected site is often required."
25,"Atypical P-ANCA Titer. Testing for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA and/or C-ANCA and/or atypical P-ANCA) has been found to be useful in establishing the diagnosis of suspected vascular diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, as well as other autoimmune diseases. Clinical Significance. Testing for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA and/or C-ANCA and/or atypical P-ANCA) has been found to be useful in establishing the diagnosis of suspected vascular diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, as well as other autoimmune diseases."
26,"Smoke Smell Removal. There’s something about vinegar that gets rid of smoke smell. Because the smell of smoke is caused by the leftover resins and tars, vinegar (an acid that cuts through resin and tar) is a great way to clean those surfaces that aren’t made of fabric, and perhaps, some that are fabric. If it doesn’t have a cleaning agent in it, you’re not going to get rid of the smoke smell. Scent-generating deodorizers only serve to mask the smell. Once you take them out of the house, you’ll notice the smell of old cigarettes again. Of course, we’ve all heard of Febreze, and wonder why it works."
27,"Cigarette and cigar smoke penetrates furniture, carpets, walls, windows, painted surfaces, and just about every other nook and cranny in our homes. Smoking in a home leaves a tar residue on everything in the home. the best way to get rid of the smell is to get rid of the tar residue. 1 Try sprinkling baking soda on the carpets to soak up the odor. 2  Devise a system that pulls the smoky air outside of your home so it doesn't have time to set on your surroundings such as smoking in front of an extractor fan that is set to expel air from the room."
28,"Removing Cigarette Odors from the Car: Fresh air will work wonders. You can shampoo the floor mats, carpet and upholstery. Use Windex and clean the inside windows and use the appropriate cleaning solution to clean the dash board and seats. It's one of the best gifts you can give to yourself. One of best ways to stay quit is to spend a few hours removing the odor of cigarette smoke. Once you realize how much better your home, clothes and car smell without that stinky odor, you'll never want another cigarette again. Your first task: Throw away the ashtrays."
29,"Use scented baking soda if you like. Shades, curtains, and fixtures need to be cleaned to get rid of smoke odor. A lot of people forget to clean things like shades, chandeliers, curtains, and wall hangings, but these things have probably collected quite a bit of tar and resin from years of hanging smoke. If it doesn’t have a cleaning agent in it, you’re not going to get rid of the smoke smell. Scent-generating deodorizers only serve to mask the smell. Once you take them out of the house, you’ll notice the smell of old cigarettes again. Of course, we’ve all heard of Febreze, and wonder why it works."
30,"Thankfully, there are appropriate solutions that you can use to deal with smoke odor. Specifically, there are ingredients found around your home or garden that you can use to get rid of smoke odor. The irritating scent will be gone in no time if you know how to use these homemade solutions. You can place apple cider vinegar or just conventional white vinegar in a bowl. Put it in the corners around your home or any space where the pesky smoke odor lingers. Vinegar is a good agent to remove almost any awful scent. Trust old, faithful vinegar-cider or white vinegar."
31,"The Ammonia Method. Ammonia can also remove cigarette tar and nicotine from walls when mixed with water. Combine a tablespoon of ammonia for every cup of water, or roughly 1/2 cup of ammonia to a gallon of warm water. For painted walls, reduce the mixture to 1/4 cup to a gallon of water"
32,"I have a stale smell of fire smoke left in my sitting room and I can't get rid of the smell. Clean the hard surfaces and walls thoroughly with 1 gallon of water, 4 tablespoons of baking soda and a few drops of dish detergent. Shampoo the carpet, or sprinkle it with baking soda, let it sit for an hour, then vacuum. You can place apple cider vinegar or just conventional white vinegar in a bowl. Put it in the corners around your home or any space where the pesky smoke odor lingers. Vinegar is a good agent to remove almost any awful scent. Trust old, faithful vinegar-cider or white vinegar."
33,"1 An ozone generator will, apparently, get rid of any odor you can think of if it's left on long enough in a closed house or apartment. 2  For a quick fix to a tobacco smell which is not too engrained try placing a pot filled with water in your oven and put about five or six drops of vanilla essence into the water. 1 Try sprinkling baking soda on the carpets to soak up the odor. 2  Devise a system that pulls the smoky air outside of your home so it doesn't have time to set on your surroundings such as smoking in front of an extractor fan that is set to expel air from the room."
34,"All of these solutions can remove the cigarette stink from the walls, but the smell may linger inside the home and recontaminate the walls if you forget to clean the filters for the home's HVAC system. As you clean the walls, ventilate the house thoroughly. Ammonia can also remove cigarette tar and nicotine from walls when mixed with water. Combine a tablespoon of ammonia for every cup of water, or roughly 1/2 cup of ammonia to a gallon of warm water."
35,How to remove cigarette odor from a car. Step No 4. Extract the residues (hot water and smoke odor control product) with your wet vac (I use the small wand for this as shown below). get rid of smoke smell get rid of smoke smell. Step No 5. Finish with very hot water again and leave to dry. 
36,"A stroke is caused by a disturbance of the blood supply to the brain. The blood vessels that normally supply blood to the brain can be compromised by becoming blocked or bleeding.Both scalp and body acupuncture are techniques that can be used to aid recovery from a stroke. Nerve Paralysis. Chinese research workers claim that acupuncture can be used to treat the symptoms of spina bifida, such as incontinence, although no claim has been made that acupuncture can affect the anatomical abnormality."
37,"Once a clear diagnosis has been made acupuncture can usually be used to relieve this type of pain. Many of these 'acute pains' represent a self-limiting disease process; for instance a small burn is usually excruciatingly painful for a few days and then settles. Nerve Paralysis. Chinese research workers claim that acupuncture can be used to treat the symptoms of spina bifida, such as incontinence, although no claim has been made that acupuncture can affect the anatomical abnormality."
38,"Once a clear diagnosis has been made acupuncture can usually be used to relieve this type of pain. Many of these 'acute pains' represent a self-limiting disease process; for instance a small burn is usually excruciatingly painful for a few days and then settles. Some of this work is excellent but, for a variety of technical reasons, some is poor. Clinical trials have been completed on knee, hip, elbow, neck and lower back pain, and the information from these trials shows that significant pain relief can be achieved in about 70 per cent of those who receive acupuncture."
39,"Acupuncture is one of the oldest, most commonly used medical procedures in the world. Research shows that acupuncture is beneficial in treating a variety of health conditions. The term acupuncture describes a family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomical points on the body by a variety of techniques. Nerve Paralysis. Chinese research workers claim that acupuncture can be used to treat the symptoms of spina bifida, such as incontinence, although no claim has been made that acupuncture can affect the anatomical abnormality."
40,"Research work by Chinese physiologists has shown, quite clearly, that acupuncture can reduce the acidity of the stomach and this may be one of the mechanisms by which acupuncture heals stomach ulcers and other digestive diseases. Nerve Paralysis. Chinese research workers claim that acupuncture can be used to treat the symptoms of spina bifida, such as incontinence, although no claim has been made that acupuncture can affect the anatomical abnormality."
41,"Acupuncture is a component of the health care system of China that can be traced back at least 2,500 years. The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that there are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease."
42,"Acupuncture is a 3,000-year-old healing technique of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In 1997, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) documented and publicized acupuncture’s safety and efficacy for treating a wide range of conditions. By stimulating the body’s various systems, acupuncture can help to resolve pain, and improve sleep, digestive function, and sense of well-being."
43,"All of these patterns of visual impairment can be helped through Chinese medicine by correcting the imbalance through acupuncture and lifestyle changes. In order to have great results with this problem, it’s always good to recognize any vision problems early on before the problems fully develop. "
44,"Acupuncture is a typical Chinese medicine treatment method which treats internal diseases through external methods. Clinically, the doctor will firstly examine the patients, ascertain the key of treatment, which channels are lesioned, whether the disease property is cold or hot, and make a diagnosis of the disease. Acupuncture is a way to unblock or influence chi and help it flow back into balance. Acupuncture is done by manipulating thin, solid needles that have been inserted into acupuncture points in the skin. Sometimes heat, pressure or mild electrical current is used along with needles to treat diseases."
45,"therefore it's a good idea to use [math.h]. and in general, for such header pairs, to use the [.h] version. I would disagree. The only reason the .h versions exist is for compatibility. The C headers are listed under [depr.c.headers] for a reason. 9. @Jesse: the argument goes that if you include math.h, then you know you're dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace. If you include cmath then you may or may not be dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace."
46,"They are C++ standard library headers. The headers are headers defined by the C standard library: The C++ standard library also makes available the facilities of the C standard library, suitably adjusted to ensure static type safety. The C++ headers, for the most part, have content identical to the corresponding C library headers except that the names are all defined in the std namespace.

47,"2. I've seen some information about differences between things like iostream vs iostream.h. From what I gathered from those the difference between them is that the version without the .h extension will not populate the namespace while the version with the extension will. 9. @Jesse: the argument goes that if you include math.h, then you know you're dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace. If you include cmath then you may or may not be dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace."
48,"Overview over the Functions of CMATH. In C++ and Delphi, synonyms are defined for all these functions. The synonyms do not have a prefix, since the data type information is implicitly handled by the compiler. Only in the following cases, the conversion really makes sense: 1  You have only multiplications and related math functions (like square, sqrt, ipow). 2  You have to call the complex exponential function. 3  You are in polar coordinates and have to calculate the logarithm."
49,"Square Root (The sqrt Function). C++ cmath library includes a square root function, which has the signature: double sqrt (double x); . That is, it calculates and returns the square root of x as a double value. If the function is called with an integer argument, the C++ compiler will convert it to a double before calling the function. The notation for division in mathematical formulas is similar to the operator used in C++. For example, the formula P/T is converted to C++ as P/T or as pressure / temperature. But what about a formula like this:"
50,Basically I have to raise a power. I'm using the volume formula V=pi*r^2*h. I already declared PI using #declare PI 3.141592. But I just learned I cannot simply do (radius)^2 in C++ rather there's a power function pow() I have to do (around those terms not done fully learning it yet).

54,"Maple Tree Identification; Maple trees can be easily identified by their leaves. The leaves in most species are palmate veined and lobed, with 3-9 (rarely to 13) veins each leading to a lobe, one of which is central or apical. Other species of the Acer genus are shrubs less than 10m (30ft) tall with a number of small trunks (and or branches) originating at ground level. Most Maple species are deciduous, however a few species in southern Asia and the Mediterranean region are evergreen."
55,"The red maple, swamp maple or soft maple, is a common species in eastern Canada. This maple is highly variable and goes by several different names. It also hybridizes with the silver maple causing several intermediate varieties to occur. Young trees provide browse for deer. There are ten species (some have as many as three different names) of maple tree native to Canada. They grow in all areas of the country except the territories. The sugar maple, an eastern species, may be called hard or rock maple, and is the principal source of maple syrup and sugar."
56,"Red Maple Trees. The fall foliage of red maples, or swamp maple trees  (Acer rubrum spp.), unfortunately sometimes makes a liar out of the trees' name. That's why it's best to stick with cultivars known for their fall color consistency, such as 'Autumn Blaze' "
57,"Submit. Red maple, known botanically as Acer rubrum, is a species of deciduous tree know for its rich red fall foliage. There are numerous cultivars that vary from leaf shape and size to exact hue of fall foliage. "
58,"Photo Credit: Image by Sids1 via Flickr. The species and common names for this maple comes from the fact that the leaves are similar to those of the sycamore (Platanus). This tree does well with the conditions in urban areas like salt and pollution. The Amur maple is one of the smaller trees in the Acer genus. Once established, it will have some drought resistance. In some areas it can be invasive, so check with your extension office first before planting. The 'Embers' and 'Flame' varieties have especially vibrant fall colors in both leaves and fruit."
59,"Like the red maple, silver maple is a relatively short-lived tree when compared to the sugar or black maple, living perhaps. 130-150 years. Because of its fast growth rate, however, mature trees can achieve diameters in excess of 3 feet and heights in excess of 100 feet. Red maple is one of the most abundant and widespread hardwood trees in North America (Figure 3.8). Probably no other species of forest tree, certainly no hardwood, can thrive on a wider variety of soil types and sites."
60,"There are thirteen native maple species in North America (Table 3-1). While most of these species are probably tapped to some extent, at least by hobbyists, sugar and black maple, along with red maple (Acer rubrum), provide most of the commercial sap. Red maple is one of the most abundant and widespread hardwood trees in North America (Figure 3.8). Probably no other species of forest tree, certainly no hardwood, can thrive on a wider variety of soil types and sites."
61,"There are many types of Maple (Acer) species, and this genus consists of tree and shrub growth form types. This genus contains mostly species that are deciduous trees growing to 10 to 45m (30 to 145ft) in height, see Maple pictures on this page. Other species of the Acer genus are shrubs less than 10m (30ft) tall with a number of small trunks (and or branches) originating at ground level. Most Maple species are deciduous, however a few species in southern Asia and the Mediterranean region are evergreen."

We do not have high-speed Internet so please do not send photos of trees or leaves unless they are smaller than 30 kb in size. Sugar and black maple both grow in the shade of other trees (they are shade tolerant), and trees of many different ages (sizes) are often found in a forest. Both species are also found in stands composed of trees that are essentially all the same age (size)."
63,"Typical Life Expectancy. On average, owners can anticipate Staffordshire Terriers to live between 9 and 15 years. However, all members of the breed are indeed individuals with different medical circumstances, so these numbers often greatly vary. Some Staffordshire Terriers may live less than 9 years, while others may surpass 15 years by a mile."
64,"Dog Size. Research shows that larger dogs live for a shorter period of time when compared to smaller ones. For example, an Irish Wolfhound (average 115 lbs) has an average lifespan of 7 years, while a Jack Russell Terrier (average 15 lbs) can live up to 13-16 years. Chihauhuas are normally referred to as the breed with the longest lifespan. They average 15-20 years and are one of the smallest dog breeds. The oldest Chihuahua on record 1, Megabyte, died at the age of 20 years and 265 days."
65,"The life expectancy of the Yorkshire Terrier is between is between 12 to 15 years with a median age of 13.5 years. Female Yorkies live-on average - 1.5 years longer than males. Since this is such a threat to the life span of the Yorkshire Terrier, moderate to severe cases are treated with surgery. Over 50% of dogs that have shunts severe enough to cause clinical signs and changes to behavior will die in one year without this surgical procedure."
66,"Report Abuse. Cairn Terriers make wonderful pets for all ages of family members and with proper care, which includes a healthy diet (making sure to keep them trim and fit), exercise and lots of love, they have an average life span of 12-15 years with many living longer. Source(s): Cairn Terrier Club of America www.puppydogweb.com."
67,"The average life span of a Boston Terrier is around 11 and 15 years. The life span all depends according to the general health, diet, and living conditions of the individual dog. "
68,"There are 2 main reasons why this breed does have a life span that is longer than the national average: 1) Toy breeds life longer than medium and large breed dogs. 2) The Yorkshire Terrier is a rather healthy breed. The majority of health issues that Yorkies contend with are not fatal. Since this is such a threat to the life span of the Yorkshire Terrier, moderate to severe cases are treated with surgery. Over 50% of dogs that have shunts severe enough to cause clinical signs and changes to behavior will die in one year without this surgical procedure."
69,"The Rat Terrier life expectancy is about 25 years. Well, the long life span of Rat Terrier will never make you feel lonely and keep your house lively. The average Rat Terrier life span is about 15 - 18 years. With good dog care you can extend the life span of Rat Terrier to over 25 years. Many experts even say the Rat Terrier life expectancy is just 13 to 16"

87,"Exploring the sea caves of Na Pali Coast is the highlight of our raft tours, and is included in all tours (conditions permitting). The sea caves along the Na Pali Coast are formed from the harsh wave action of the Pacific Ocean slamming into the porous lava. At 1,155 feet in length, the Waiahuakua Sea Cave is second on the list in rank for the world’s longest sea caves. This dark and spooky sea cave has a separate entrance and exit, and is thus referred to as the Double-Door Cave."
88,"Areas known for large concentrations of sea caves include the Pacific coast states of the USA (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California, and especially, California's Channel Islands); the Na Pali coast of Kauai; the Greek Isles; the British Isles, and many other places with cliffs of good solid rock to host the caves. Regions where sea caves form are often associated with arches and sea stacks. Often these are remnants from collapses of sea caves, and in some cases may line up along what had been a fault line in a rock unit that has been carved by the sea into isolated stacks of rock."
89,"Probably the world's two most famous sea caves are the Blue Grotto on the Italian island of Capri (left), and Fingal's Cave on the British island of Staffa (formed in columnar basalt). Regions where sea caves form are often associated with arches and sea stacks. Often these are remnants from collapses of sea caves, and in some cases may line up along what had been a fault line in a rock unit that has been carved by the sea into isolated stacks of rock."
90,"While many of these caves are found in the craggy coastlines of Europe, some of the largest sea caves in the world — such as California's Painted Cave and Oregon's Sea Lion Cave — can be found on the rocky Pacific coast of the United States. "
91,"The primary process involved is erosion. Sea caves are found throughout the world, actively forming along present coastlines and as relict sea caves on former coastlines. Some of the largest wave-cut caves in the world are found on the coast of Norway, but are now 100 feet or more above present sea level. Some of the best-known sea caves are European. Fingal's Cave, on the Scottish island of Staffa, is a spacious cave some 70 m long, formed in columnar basalt."
92,"Most sea caves are small in relation to other types. A compilation of sea-cave surveys as of July 2014 (Long sea caves of the world) shows 2 over 1000 meters, 6 over 400 meters, nine over 300 meters, 25 over 200 meters, and 108 over 100 meters in length. Some of the best-known sea caves are European. Fingal's Cave, on the Scottish island of Staffa, is a spacious cave some 70 m long, formed in columnar basalt."
93,"Numerous sea caves have been surveyed in England, Scotland, and in France, particularly on the Normandy coast. Until 2013, the largest known sea caves were found along the west coast of the United States, the Hawaiian islands, and the Shetland Islands. Some of the best-known sea caves are European. Fingal's Cave, on the Scottish island of Staffa, is a spacious cave some 70 m long, formed in columnar basalt."
94,"Sea Caves. Sea caves are also known as Littoral caves. They are formed by the action of waves pounding against the land and removing material over time. Sea caves are relatively small, with only a few over 300 meters in length. Because this type of cave is generally found facing the open sea, just getting to them can be an adventure in itself! Many of these caves can only be approached and explored by kayak or small boat. Others drain out at low tide and can be explored on foot. Sea caves are obviously located in coastal areas. Examples are the sea caves of Santa Cruz Island in California and the Na Pali Coast on the island of Kauai, Hawaii."
95,"Painted Cave, a large sea cave, Santa Cruz Island, California. Sea caves are found along coasts around the world. A special case is littoral caves, which are formed by wave action in zones of weakness in sea cliffs. Often these weaknesses are faults, but they may also be dykes or bedding-plane contacts. Some wave-cut caves are now above sea level because of later uplift. Elsewhere, in places such as Thailand's Phang Nga Bay, solutional caves have been flooded by the sea and are now subject to littoral erosion. Sea caves are generally around 5 to 50 metres (16 to 164 ft) in length, but may exceed 300 metres (980 ft)."

105,"The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low fuel costs. Nuclear (fission) power stations, excluding the contribution from naval nuclear fission reactors, provided 11% of the world's electricity in 2012, somewhat less than that generated by hydro-electric stations at 16%."
106,"Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power station. The term includes nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion. Nuclear (fission) power stations, excluding the contribution from naval nuclear fission reactors, provided 11% of the world's electricity in 2012, somewhat less than that generated by hydro-electric stations at 16%."
107,"Our Nuclear Energy Plants. Hatch nuclear plant, located near Baxley in southeastern Georgia. Georgia Power's nuclear facilities, Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle, are two of the three nuclear facilities in the Southern Company system. One great advantage to nuclear power is that it is emission-free energy. Since nuclear power plants use so little fuel, the volume of nuclear waste is much smaller than the volume of waste from fossil fuel power plants. Even though nuclear waste is radioactive, its small volume enables safe removal from our communities."
108,"There are currently 61 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 99 nuclear reactors in 30 states in the United States. Thirty-five of these plants have two or more reactors. The Palo Verde plant in Arizona has 3 reactors and had the largest combined net summer generating capacity of 3,937 megawatts (MW) in 2012. "
109,"Davis-Besse. Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Ohio’s first nuclear power plant, is located 35 miles east of Toledo. The single reactor plant produced its first electricity in 1977. "

They include runoff or effluent from sawmills, pulp manufacture, fruit and vegetable canning, cleaning of dairies, slaughtering of meat animals, tanning, manufacturing of cornstarch and soya protein, sugar refining, distilling, wool processing etc. For more than a century air pollution has affected agriculture. Burning coal and petroleum produces poisonous sulfur oxides. Fluorides result from mining, smelting and glass and ceramic manufacture."
116,"Water pollution in a rural stream due to runoff from farming activity in New Zealand. The environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world. Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. A wide range of agricultural chemicals are used and some become pollutants through use, misuse, or ignorance. Pollutants from agriculture have a huge effect on water quality. Agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) solution impacts lakes, rivers, wetlands, estuaries, and groundwater."
117,"Harmful pollutants that enter the air from sources other than agriculture and that damage plants and crops are classified as: 1  acid gases. 2  products of combustion. 3  products of reactions in the air. 4  miscellaneous effluents. For more than a century air pollution has affected agriculture. Burning coal and petroleum produces poisonous sulfur oxides. Fluorides result from mining, smelting and glass and ceramic manufacture."
118,"Most ocean pollution begins on land. When large tracts of land are plowed, the exposed soil can erode during rainstorms. Much of this runoff flows to the sea, carrying with it agricultural fertilizers and pesticides. Eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land. One of the biggest sources is called nonpoint source pollution, which occurs as a result of runoff."
119,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Agricultural pollution refers to biotic and abiotic byproducts of farming practices that result in contamination or degradation of the environment and surrounding ecosystems, and/or cause injury to humans and their economic interests. "
120,"Types and Effects of Pollutants. Agricultural water pollution can have variety of negative effects. Not only do substantial environmental problems result, but many of the pollutants produced by farms (minerals, chemicals and pathogens, to name a few) can make water unsafe for human consumption. Case in Point: Fish Kills. In the 2000 National Water Quality Inventory conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), agricultural activity was identified as a source of pollution for 48% of stream and river water, and for 41% of lake water."
121,"Nonpoint source pollution can make river and ocean water unsafe for humans and wildlife. In some areas, this pollution is so bad that it causes beaches to be closed after rainstorms. More than one-third of the shellfish-growing waters of the United States are adversely affected by coastal pollution. Eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land. One of the biggest sources is called nonpoint source pollution, which occurs as a result of runoff."

Advantages. Costs may decrease when using biofuels. Biofuel advocates frequently point out the advantages of these plant-and animal-based fuels, such as: 1  Cost: Biofuels have the potential to be significantly less expensive than gasoline and other fossil fuels."
134,"A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe."
135,"Biofuels are not 100% safe but they are much safer than fossil fuels. If you were to spill a large quantity of biofuel into a concentrated area, it would likely kill living organisms and contaminate surround soil or water. However, the scale of the impact would be orders of magnitude smaller than with fossil fuels. Availability of Biofuels. Unlike fossil fuels, biofuels are a renewable energy source. Because they are derived from crops that can be harvested annually, or in the case of algae monthly, biofuels are theoretically unlimited. Despite this surface appearance of unlimited availability, biofuels do have restrictions."
136,"Fuels that have been extracted from plants and crops are known as biofuels. Of these, the most commonly extracted and used one is Bioethanol or simply Ethanol and Biodiesel. It is blended with gasoline and can be used as an alternative fuel for your car. 3. Renewable: Most of the fossil fuels will expire and end up in smoke one day. Since most of the sources like manure, corn, switchgrass, soyabeans, waste from crops and plants are renewable and are not likely to run out any time soon, making the use of biofuels efficient in nature."

Many people with childhood-onset osteoporosis do not have a mutation in the LRP5 gene. (When its cause is unknown, the condition is often called idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis). It is likely that mutations in other genes that have not been identified are involved in this condition. Read more about"
156,"Mutations in the LRP5 gene can cause juvenile primary osteoporosis. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that participates in a chemical signaling pathway that affects the way cells and tissues develop. In particular, the LRP5 protein is involved in the regulation of bone mineral density. Many people with childhood-onset osteoporosis do not have a mutation in the LRP5 gene. (When its cause is unknown, the condition is often called idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis). It is likely that mutations in other genes that have not been identified are involved in this condition.

157,"Osteoporosis is a common disease with a strong genetic component. In recent years, some progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of osteoporosis. Genetic factors contribute to osteoporosis by influencing not only bone mineral density but also bone size, bone quality, and bone turnover. Meta-analysis has been used to define the role of several candidate genes in osteoporosis"
158,"Genes that cause monogenic bone diseases also contribute to regulation of bone mass in the normal population. Genome-wide association studies and functional genomics approaches have recently begun to apply to genetic studies of osteoporosis. In recent years, some progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of osteoporosis. Genetic factors contribute to osteoporosis by influencing not only bone mineral density but also bone size, bone quality, and bone turnover."
159,"Defining Osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease marked by reduced bone strength leading to an increased risk of fractures, or broken bones. Bone strength has two main features: bone mass (amount of bone) and bone quality. Osteoporosis is the major underlying cause of fractures in postmenopausal women and the elderly. Although low bone mass (or low bone density) plays an important role in determining a person's risk of osteoporosis, it is only one of many risk factors for fractures. Fracture risk results from a combination of bone-dependent and bone-independent factors."
160,"But as spiders are very difficult to farm, a great deal of effort has gone into producing spider silk by genetic engineering. There are major challenges in producing spider silk through genetic engineering. First, the repetitive modules of the spider silk gene [1] tends to become truncated in the transgenic host through recombination between repeated modules of the same gene. Second, the high content of glycine (43-45 %) puts an unusual burden on the translation machinery of the host cell [3]. "
161,"INTRODUCTION Silk is a protein fiber made by silk worms and is the only natural fiber that is a filament fiber. Originally, it was believed that an ancient Chinese princess was the first to discover the process for manufacturing silk fabric from the filament fiber produced by silk worms. "
162,"Benefits of Silk. Besides its luxurious softness and lustrous beauty, there are benefits of silk that other fabrics, whether natural or man-made, simply cannot match. These advantages of silk have rightly earned silk its reputation as the queen of fabrics. 1 An all-climate fabric, silk is warm and cozy in winter and comfortably cool when temperatures rise. 2  Its natural temperature-regulating properties give silk this paradoxical ability to cool and warm simultaneously. 3  Silk garments thus outperform other fabrics in both summer and winter."

166,"Silk is a fabric made from animal fiber generated by silkworms that spin it to build cocoons. Silk is generally used for clothing such as blouses, dresses and ties, but it can also be used to make sheets and curtains. It has a fine, elegant and delicate appearance, but as a fabric, it has several disadvantages."
167,"Delicacy. Although silk is valued for its delicacy, that same delicacy is considered a disadvantage of the fabric. Silk fades easily in direct sunlight, so a new garment dried outside can look old and worn. The fabric has a tendency to develop a yellow color over time and is particularly prone to perspiration stains. Silk is generally used for clothing such as blouses, dresses and ties, but it can also be used to make sheets and curtains. It has a fine, elegant and delicate appearance, but as a fabric, it has several disadvantages."
168,"Cost. Silk is one of the most expensive fabrics on the market. Compared to cotton or nylon, silk is pricey. Silk ties or silk sheets cost significantly more than cotton counterparts because of the fabric's elegant appearance and the difficulty in its manufacture. Silk is generally used for clothing such as blouses, dresses and ties, but it can also be used to make sheets and curtains. It has a fine, elegant and delicate appearance, but as a fabric, it has several disadvantages."
169,"Silk comes from several different insects, but the type of silk we wear is most often woven by the larvae of the Bombyx mori (mulberry silkworm) which is raised in captivity for production purposes. Silk is a versatile fabric that is used in many different types of clothing because of its many benefits. It is thought that since silk is a substance created during a protective period for silkworms, the cocoon-derived fabric protects against natural threats like allergens. Dust mites, fungus and various other growths tend to stay off of silk materials, keeping your bed or clothes more allergy free."
170,"Vegetative reproduction is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants where new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores by meiosis or syngamy. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants."
171,"Asexual reproduction requires only one parent. Since there is only one parent, there is no exchanging of genetic information, and the offspring are clones of the parent. Asexual reproduction in plants can occur in a variety of forms, including budding, vegetative propagation, and fragmentation."
172,"Asexual reproduction in liverworts: a caducous phylloid germinating. Asexual reproduction is a mode of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single organism, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it does not involve the fusion of gametes and almost never changes the number of chromosomes. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants."
173,"Asexual Reproduction. Asexual reproduction is advantageous in allowing beneficial combinations of characteristics to continue unchanged and in eliminating the often vulnerable stages of early embryonic growth. It is found in most plants, bacteria, and protists and the lower invertebrates. "
174,"Why does sex -- that is, sexual reproduction -- exist? In many ways, asexual reproduction is a better evolutionary strategy: Only one parent is required, and all of that parent's genes are passed on to its progeny. In sexual reproduction, only half of each parent's genes are passed to the next generation. "
175,"Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Sexual reproduction allows traits that are adaptive/beneficial to spread through a population and species fairly quickly. It also allows 2 or more beneficial traits that have evolved independently in 2 or more individuals to be passed along to the same descendants. Sexual reproduction also promotes genetic diversity, so that a population is less susceptible in case of disease epidemics. For example, when the plague hit Europe, some individuals by chance had mutations that allowed them to survive, and they did."
176,Posted on. (Answer #2). The sexual reproduction is beneficial for the population due to the following reasons: 1. The environment is constantly changing and there need the change of the characteristics to sustain in the changing environment. 2. 
177,Another reason why sexual reproduction is so beneficial is that it is better at combating disease. If a parent has a disease like Huntington's disease and that person reproduces with someone who doesn't have the disease there is a chance that when they reproduce the child will not have the disease. Why Sexual Reproduction is Better than Asexual Reproduction. I feel like a good place to start is with an investigation to understand why sexual reproduction is better than asexual r
178,"Current hypotheses suggest that asexual reproduction may have short term benefits when rapid population growth is important or in stable environments, while sexual reproduction offers a net advantage by allowing more rapid generation of genetic diversity, allowing adaptation to changing environments. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants."
179,"There is no exact date when opera began. Rather the art form was a product of musical evolution. It emerged from the various forms of classical music that was popular in the 1400s. Origin. During the early 1500s, stage drama with music became popular in Europe. However the complexities of the stories grew. The earliest play on record is that of Jacopo Peri’s Dafne. This took place in 1597. Despite some basic differences, it contained the elements found in the art form today. It can be said that when opera began it was with Dafne."
180,"Answer: The origins of opera, unfortunately, are not cut and dry. There are a variety of factors that may have lead to the creation of opera; perhaps the earliest contributor being the plays from Ancient Greece where music was inserted. During the renaissance period, intermedi (musical works often sang to the accompaniment of staged actions or dance) closed each act. In the second half of the 16th century, entertainers hired to perform during courtly banquets or high-class parties, commonly known as Mascherate, slowly gained popularity. The polyphonic madrigal comedies belong to this type of entertainment; many of which were staged in private rooms and residences."
181,"Main roles of the opera were written for the castrato. By Espie Estrella. An opera is generally referred to as a stage presentation or work that combines music, costumes, and scenery to relay a story. Most operas are sung, with no spoken lines.. The word opera is actually a shortened word for opera in musica. 1 Opera Semiseria-This type of opera has a serious story but has a happy ending. 2  This is why some loosely define it as a combination of the elements of both comic and serious opera."
182,"Dafne by Jacopo Peri was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today, although with only five instrumental parts it was much more like a chamber opera than either the preceding intermedi or the operas of Claudio Monteverdi a few years later. The libretto was by Ottavio Rinuccini, who reused some of the material in the first opera Dafne in 1597. The art form known as opera originated in Italy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, though it drew upon older traditions of medieval and Renaissance courtly entertainment."

185,"The word opera, meaning work in Italian, was first used in the modern musical and theatrical sense in 1639 and soon spread to the other European languages. The libretto was by Ottavio Rinuccini, who reused some of the material in the first opera Dafne in 1597. The art form known as opera originated in Italy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, though it drew upon older traditions of medieval and Renaissance courtly entertainment."
186,"The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by Wagner in Germany and Verdi in Italy. The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Puccini and Strauss in the early 20th century. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style."
187,"Most of the music for Dafne is unfortunately lost (the libretto was printed and survives), but one of Peri's many later operas, Euridice, dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day.

188,"The word pericardium literally means 'about' or 'around' (peri-) the 'heart' (cardia). This layer is composed of three membranous layers that encircle the exterior of the heart: the outer fibrous pericardium, the parietal pericardium, and the inner epicardium (also referred to as the visceral pericardium)."
189,"The endocardium is the most inner layer of the heart. It forms the inner layer of all four heart chambers and is directly connected to all the inner cardiac appendages, such as the bicuspid valve, the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve, the aortic valve, the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles."
190,"Each layer is specialized in its structure and function. Thus, all three layers function together to ensure proper functioning of the heart and to ensure that it pumps blood properly to all the organs in the body."
191,The epicardium is the layer of muscle found covering the external surfaces of the heart. It is directly fused with the myocardium internally and is in contact with the serous layer of the pericardium. It is sometimes considered as a division of the inner
